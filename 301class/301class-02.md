# Code 301 Class 02 Reading Notes

## [React lifecycle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

There are three phases of the component lifecylce:

1. **Mounting**; When an instance of a component is being created an inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, **static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, comonentDidMount,** and **UNSAFE_componentWillMount** all occur in this order during mounting.
2. **Updating**; Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.**static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componenetDidUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps**
3. **Unmounting**; Final phase of the lifecylce if called when a componenet is being removed from the DOM. **componentWillUnmount** is the only lifecylce even during this phase.

**constructor()** for a React component is called before it is mounted. If the component is a subclass you should call super(props), or the props will be undefined. constructors can be used to assign state using this.state or bind event handle methods to an instance.

**render()** is the only required method in a class component. It will examine `this.props` and `this.state` when called. The render function should not modify the component state because it would cause a lot of bugs by changing the state every time it rerenders. Should also not directly interace with the browser.

**componentDidMount()** This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If anythig needs loading using a network requrest or initialize the DOM, it should go here.

## Reading Questions

1. **Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?** Render happens first, the React updates DOM and refs, followed by componentDidMount.
2. **What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?** An instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM, constructor is called.
3. **Following things in the order they happen:** copnstructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, componenetWillUnmount.
4. **componentDidMount()** This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If anythig needs loading using a network requrest or initialize the DOM, it should go here.
