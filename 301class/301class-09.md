## [Consepts of Functional Programming in Javascript](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aan)

1. **What is functional programming?** `Functional programming is a pragramming paraadigm - a style of building the structure and elemnts of computer programs - that treatscomputation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data` - [Wikipedia ~ Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
2. **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**
3. **What are the benefits of a pure function?**
   - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
   - It does not cause any observable side effects
4. **What is immutability** Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
5. **What is Referentiality transparency** If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

> pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

[Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)

1. **What is a module?** A module is another JavaScript File.
2. **What does the word 'require' do?** It passes a function from one module to another.
3. **How do we bring another module into the file that we are working in?**
   1. Write out `require('')`, and withing the paranthesis and string is going to be a path to the module that we require in the file we are working in.
   2. Then, write in the the file that we want to bring in with a dot and foward slash. `require('./count.js')`
4. **What do we have to do to make a module available?**
   1. Write `module.exports =` which sets whatever we want to be made available outside of this module.
   2. Write the function `counter` we would like to be available outside of this module `module.exports = counter;`
   3. In thefile we want to pass to, create a variable to the require we are passing through `let counter = require('./count');`
   4. Type in `node app` in your terminal, and thats how we create a module and how we require a module in another JavaScript file.
