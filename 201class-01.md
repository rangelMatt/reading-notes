## HOW THE WEB WORKS

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. in order fo you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System(DNS) server.

1) When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example [google.com](https://google.com/), [bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.com/), [microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/).

2) Your computer contacts a network of servers call Domain Name System(DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address asssociated with the requested domain name.

3) The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.

4) The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
