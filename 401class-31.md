# Code 401 Class 31 Reading Notes

## [DRF Permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/)

> Permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access, with authentication and throttling.

- `request.user` and `request.auth` have authentication information to determine if the incoming requests should be permitted.

### How Permissions are determined

Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

Permission checks fail, either a '403 Forbidden' or a '401 Unauthorized' response will be returned, according to the following rules:

- The request was successfully authenticated, but permissions were denied. - *An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.*
- The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use `WWW-Authenticate` headers. - *An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.*
- The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use `WWW-Authenticate` headers. - *An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, with an appropriate `WWW-Authenticate` header will be returned.*

### Object level permissions

- `.get_object()`:  When called, object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views.
- `.check_object_permissions(request, obj)`: Gets called when you override the `get_object` method ona generic view. Need to call it at the view point at which you've retrieved the object.

### Setting the permission policy

- `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES`: This maybe set globally, the default permission policy.
- `APIView`: Sets the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis.

### AP Reference

- `AllowAny`: A permission class that will allow unrestricted access, **regardless of if the request was authenticated or unauthenticated.**
- `IsAuthenticated`: A permission class that denies permission to any unauthenticated user, and allow permission otherwise. This permission is suitable if you want your API to only be accessible to registered users.
- `IsAdminUser`: A permission class that will deny permission to *any* user, unless `user.is_staff` is `True`.
- `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`: A permission class that will allow authenticated users to perform any request. REquests for unauthorised users will only be permitted if the request method is one of the "safe" methods; `GET`, `HEAD`, or `OPTIONS`.

### DjangoModelPermissions

- `django.contrib.auth`: A permission class that is Djangos standard model permission. Must be applied to views that have a `.queryset` property or `get_queryset()` method.

### DjangoObject Permissions

`DjangoModelPermissions`: A permission class that ties into Django's standard object - permissions framework that allows per-object permissions on models. In order to use this permission class, you'll also need to add permission backend that supports object-level permissions, such as django-guardian.
