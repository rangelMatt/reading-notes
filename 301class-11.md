| SQL | NoSQL |
|:---:|:---:|
| Databases are primarly called as Relational Databases (REDBMS) | Databases are primarly called as non-relational or distributed database |
| Databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data | Databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to |
| Databases have predifined schema | Databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| Databases are vertically scalable. They are scaled by increasing the hourse-power of the hardware | Databases are horizontally scalable. They are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce load |
| Databases uses SQL (structure query language) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful | Databases have queries which are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes this is referred as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.|

1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?** SELECT id, name price FROM products
2. **Give a real world example.** Customer data that includes name, address, city, postal code, and country, as input values
3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?** Highly preferred for large data set.
4. **Give a real world example.** Can use customer data as well, with key-values
5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?** NoSQL
6. **Which type of database is best for scalability** SQL

1. **What does SQL stand for?** Structured Query Language
1. **What is a relational database?** It works with certain assumptions in  a certain way. This works with databases such as a products table.
1. **What type of structure does a relational database work with?** A products table.
1. **What is a ‘schema’?** Defines how data is organized within a relational database. This is inclusive of logical constraints such as, table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities.
1. **What is inside of a Mongo database?** Contains Collections, inside Collections we have Documents. It is good for Heavy Data, Extensive REad/Write DB Operations.
1. **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.** MongoDB is more flexible, as it doesn't need the collections to have the same set of fields. SQL uses RDBMS which requires same sets of fields.
1. **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?** NoSQL is not as efficient when coming to analytics and drawing business insights, as SQL. Does best with few features.
