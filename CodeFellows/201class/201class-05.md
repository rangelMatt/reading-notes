# Code 201 Class 5 Reading Notes

## Images

To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no slocing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

* `src` This tells the browaswer where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL point to an image on your own site.

* `alt` This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

* `title` You can also use the title attribute with the `<img>` element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.

You can adjust the height and width of images by specifying how man pixels on each setting.

An image can be placed:

 1) before a paragraph

 2) Inside the start of a paragraph

 3) I the middle of a paragraph

 4) Align to the left of a paragraph

 5) Align to the right of the paragraph

 > You Should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

## Color

CSS3: HSL Colors

**CSS3** introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors usin hur, saturation, and lightness values

> **Hue** - Is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL Colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slided with values from 0 too 360.
> **Saturation** - is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
> **Lightness** - Is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is norma. Lightness is sometimes referred to as **luminosity**.

## Font

Responding to Users:

* `:hover` - This is applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device such as a mouse.

* `:active` - This is applied when an element is being activated by a user; for example, when a button is being pressed or a link being clicked.

* `:focus` - This is applied when an element has focus. Any element that you can interact with, such as a link you can click on or any form control can have focus.

> USE JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs trasnparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contatain animations.
