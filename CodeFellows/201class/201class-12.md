## Charts

**Charts** are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They're easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they're not always easy to create.

1) Download [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js). Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you'll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script.

```json
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

2) Drawing a line chart

To Draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTMML in which our Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of out HTML page:

```json
<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
```

There are two more charts you can build (pie and bar) that you can find [here](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/)

Below is the full script;

```json
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
        <!-- import plugin script -->
        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- line chart canvas element -->
        <canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
        <!-- pie chart canvas element -->
        <canvas id="countries" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
        <!-- bar chart canvas element -->
        <canvas id="income" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
        <script>
            // line chart data
            var buyerData = {
                labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
                datasets : [
                {
                    fillColor : "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",
                    strokeColor : "#ACC26D",
                    pointColor : "#fff",
                    pointStrokeColor : "#9DB86D",
                    data : [203,156,99,251,305,247]
                }
            ]
            }
            // get line chart canvas
            var buyers = document.getElementById('buyers').getContext('2d');
            // draw line chart
            new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);
            // pie chart data
            var pieData = [
                {
                    value: 20,
                    color:"#878BB6"
                },
                {
                    value : 40,
                    color : "#4ACAB4"
                },
                {
                    value : 10,
                    color : "#FF8153"
                },
                {
                    value : 30,
                    color : "#FFEA88"
                }
            ];
            // pie chart options
            var pieOptions = {
                 segmentShowStroke : false,
                 animateScale : true
            }
            // get pie chart canvas
            var countries= document.getElementById("countries").getContext("2d");
            // draw pie chart
            new Chart(countries).Pie(pieData, pieOptions);
            // bar chart data
            var barData = {
                labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
                datasets : [
                    {
                        fillColor : "#48A497",
                        strokeColor : "#48A4D1",
                        data : [456,479,324,569,702,600]
                    },
                    {
                        fillColor : "rgba(73,188,170,0.4)",
                        strokeColor : "rgba(72,174,209,0.4)",
                        data : [364,504,605,400,345,320]
                    }
                ]
            }
            // get bar chart canvas
            var income = document.getElementById("income").getContext("2d");
            // draw bar chart
            new Chart(income).Bar(barData);
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Canvas

The **`<canvas>`** element differs from an `<img>` tag in that, like for `<video>`, `<audio>`, or `<picture>` elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, li,e versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content ot be displayed by those browsers.

Below you will find three functions that draw rectangles on canvas;

```json
fillRect(x, y, width, height)
  Draws a filled rectangle.

strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
  Draws a rectangular outline.

clearRect(x, y, width, height)
  Clears the specified rectangular area, making it full transparent.

```
