# JavaScript

> Definition: (JS) a lightweight, interpreted, or just in time compiled programming language with [first-class functions](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function>). While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, [many non-browser environments](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Other_usage>) also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. function programming) styles.

* [JavaScript building blocks](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks>), continues JS key fundamental features. Specifically looking at code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.
* [Introducing JavaScript objects](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects>), object-oriented nature of JS is important to understand. This will solidify more knowledge of the language.
* [Asynchronous JS](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous>), discusses asynchronous JS, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server.
* [Client-side web APIs](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs>), explores what APIs are, how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.

### Intro How Computers Work

#### What makes a computer a computer

Rather than moving or manipulate physical things, computers move data knowledged

1) take input
2) store it
3) process it
4) Output results

Computers started out as basic calculators.

Modern computers still do the same 4 things

* input - Tell a computer what to do with a computer, mouse, microphone, heart, car.
* storage - The input is then stored in memory, which creates a series of commands, which is an algorithm
* Output - Could send signals to, have a robot move, or display something on the screen.

#### Data & Binary

A single wire with electricity, the signal can send on or off. Yes or no. True or false.

Binary number system which is 0 and 1. With these two digits, we can count to any number.

Any number can be represented with 1s and 0s. The more wires you use the more numbers you can use.

Texts, images, and sounds, can be represented by numbers as well.

#### Circuits and logic

Every input or output in a computer is information.

In order to process the information that comes in, the computer needs to modify this before outputing, using circuits.

#### Hardware and Software

Circuits chips wires plugs and stuff is the hardware within the computer. Software includes app, games, etc.

CPU is the masterchip that controls all the other parts of the computer. It has circuits to do math and logic. It recievese simple commands and then stores it in the memory, and outputs.

Software language tells the CPU what to do. How do programs get on the computer? How can computer run all of them at once.

Operating system, is the master prgram that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. It has special abilities that helps control the rest of the programs.
