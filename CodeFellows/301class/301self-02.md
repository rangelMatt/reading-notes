### Using State Correctly

There are three things you should know about setState().

#### **Do not Modify State Directly**

```json
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';

// Correct 
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
```

The only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.

#### **State Updates May Be Asynchronous**

```json
//Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});

//Correct
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  count: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```

The first code may fail to update the counter. But to fix it, use a second form of setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

#### **State Updates are Merged**

When you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.

For example, your state may contain several independent variables:

```json
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    post: [],
    comments: []
  };
}

componentDidMount() {
  fetchPosts().then(response => {
    this.setState({
      posts: response.posts
    });
  });

  fetchComments().then(response => {
    this.setState({
      comments: response.comments
    });
  });
}
```

The merging is shallow, so this.setState({comments}) leaves this.state.posts intact, but completely replaces this.state.comments.
