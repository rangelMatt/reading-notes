## [Beginner's Guide to Docker](https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/)

With Docker, you can have an entire development environment isolated: programming languages, software packages, databases, and more.

> Docker is Linux containers, which are a type of [virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization).

- Upside, everyone on the same virtual machine
- Downside, size and speed
- Create an isolated box for individual projects, so one can use Python 2.7 and Django 1.5 while another can use Python 3.5 and Django 2.1 on the same computer.

- `docker container ls`: only running containers will appear.
- `Dockerfile` is like a recipe for a cake
- *image* is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
- `docker-compose.yml` says how to make the cake
- *container* is the actual, baked cake
- Dockerfiles are read from top to bottom
  - `FROM` **must** be the first instruction which lets us import a base image to use for our image.

To build containers, install `[Pipenv](https://djangoforbeginners.com/initial-setup/)`

- mkdir djangoapp && cd djangoapp
- pipenv install django==3.0
- pipenv shell

- Docker is a way to run Linux containers
- Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
- `Dockerfile` is a list of instructions for creating an image
- Images are made up of one ore more layers
- Containers are running instance of an image
- `docker-compose.yml` controls how to run the container
- Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesustem via `volumes`but things become more complex with databases.

## [Django for APIs - Library Website](https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/)

- `__init__.py` indicates that the files in the folder are part of a Python package. Without this file, we cannot import files from another directory
- `asgi.py` allows for an optional Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface to be run
- `settings.py` controls our Django project's overall settings
- `urls.py` tells Django which pages to build in response to a browser or URL request
- `wsgi.py` stand for Web Server Gateway Interface which helps Django serve our eventual web pages.

## Things I want to know more about

How do you have auto template support when creating Django files?
