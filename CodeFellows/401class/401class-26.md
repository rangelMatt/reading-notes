> Django can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. It takes care of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

Django has loads of [**extras**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/overview/) you can use to handle common web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, right out of the box.

- **Object-relational mapper**: Define your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free - but you can still write SQL if needed.
- **URLs and views**: Clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail ina high-quality web application. To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.
- **Authentication**: Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user session. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

## [How Django Works Behind the Scenes](https://wsvincent.com/how-django-works-behind-the-scenes/)

It is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It's open source and available on [**Github**](https://github.com/django/django).

- Open sourced in 2005 and developers immediately started making contributions to the code based.
  - Two issues crop up because of this, funding and control
- DSF (Django Software Foundation) supports and maintains Django ina number of capacities.
- Django Fellows are paid contractors who traige tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track
- [Donations](https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/) highly encouraged, as the total budget is usually $200,000, or less than the cost of a single Bay Area Django engineer.
