Common Terminology

- **Node** - A Tree node is a componenet which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes
- **Root** - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- **K** - A number that specifies the maximum number of a children any node may have in a k-ary tree.In a binary tree, k = 2.
- **Left** - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- **Right** - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- **Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.
- **Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not have any children.
- **Height** - The height of a trees is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

## Traversals: Depth First and Breadth First

> Depth first traversal: Going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

- Pre-order: ____
- In-order: ____
- Post-order: ____

a) left >> root >> right

b) left >> right >> root

c) root >> left >> right

```json
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left) ## 

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)
```
