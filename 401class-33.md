# Code 401 Class 33 Reading Notes

## [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

> JSON Web Token(JWT) is an open standard ([RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

### When are they useful?

- **Authorization**: Most common scenario, allows the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
- **Information Exchange**: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. This ensures that you can be sure the senders are who they say they are.

### Structure

- Header: Typically consists of two parts, the type of token, which JWT, and the signing algorithm being used.
- Payload: Contains claims, which are statements about entity and additional data.
  - Registered claims: These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended.
  - Public claims: Can be defined at will by those using JWTs. They should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry, or as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.
  - Private claims: Custom claims to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.
- Signature: Takes the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

## [DRF JWT Authentication](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html)

1. `pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt`: installs the recommended library by the DRF developers.
2. settings.py
`REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ],
}`
3. urls.py
`
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework_simplejwt import views as jwt_views

urlpatterns = [
    # Your URLs...
    path('api/token/', jwt_views.TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('api/token/refresh/', jwt_views.TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
]

## [Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html)

> [Do NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/django-admin/#runserver)> It has not gone through security audits or performance tests.

- The server started with `runservers` is not guaranteed to be performant (it's very slow), and it hasn't been built with security concerns in mind.
- Production Stack: Usually consists of multiple components, each designed and built to be really good at one specific thing. Fast reliable and very focused.
- Django uses `uwsgi.py` file, which contains a function to be called by the application server. This function gets a Python object representing the incoming request.
  - This function calls your code, and produces a response object which is passed to the WSGI server. There the response is translated into a HTTP response and is passed back to the web server, which finally delivers it to the user.
