## [How to Run Linear Regression in Python](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/)

### Using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to perform Linear Regression

> Scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning, which contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

#### Exploring Data Sets

First Step: import required python libraries

```json
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matlotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn
```

Store the data set int a lpython notebook.

```json
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
boston = load_boston()
```

`boston.keys()` explores the keys of the dictionary.
output: `['data', 'feature_names', 'DESCR', 'target']`

View each key by printing `boston` + `.data` or `.feature_names` and so on.

Convert **boston.data** into a pandas data frame(use `feature_names` to see column names and not numbers):

```json
bos = pd.DataFrame(boston.data)
bos.head()
```

Adding target prices to the bos data frame with two steps

1. boston.target[:5]
2. bos[`PRICE`] = boston.target

> pandas.DataFrame.drop: Drop removes specified labels from rows or columns.

#### Importing Linear Regression

```json
- from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
- x = bos.drop('PRICE',axis = 1)

#This creates a LinearRegression object
lm = LinearRegression()
lm
```

- lm.fit() -> fits a linear model
- lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
- lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
- lm.coef_ gives the coefficients
- lm.intercept_ gives the estimated intercepts.
- lm.predict -> calculates predicted prices

To plot predicted prices

```json
plt.scatter(bos.PRICE, lm.predict(X))
plt.xlabel('Prices: $Y_i$')
plt.ylabel('Predicted prices: $\hat{Y}_i$')
plt.title('Prices vs Predicted Prices: $Y_i$ vs $\hat{Y}_i$')
```

Output:

![Predicted prices](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Prices-vs-predicted-prices.png)

### Train-test split

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split(X, bos.PRICE, test_size=0.33, random_state=5)
print X_train.shape
print X_test.shape
print Y_train.shape
print Y_test.shape

Then build a linear regression model using train-test data sets.

lm = LinearRegression()
lm.fit(X_train, Y_train)
pred_train = lm.predict(X_train)
pred_test = lm.predict(X_test)

The calculate the mean squared error for training and test data

- Input:
  - print “Fit a model X_train, and calculate MSE with Y_train:”, np.mean((Y_train – lm.predict(X_train)) ** 2)
  - print “Fit a model X_train, and calculate MSE with X_test, Y_test:”, np.mean((Y_test – lm.predict(X_test)) ** 2)

- Output:
  - Fit a model X_train, and calculate MSE with Y_train: 19.5467584735 Fit a model X_train, and calculate MSE with X_test, Y_test: 28.5413672756

## Things I want to know more about

Statistics, I should have saved some notes when I took it.
Most of this is foreign language, requiring more research to what the article is talking about.
Can the plot be interactive? User add values and immediately manipulates data?
