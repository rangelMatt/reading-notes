# Code 401 Class 10 Reading Notes

## [Stacks & Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)

* **Stack**: Data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Stack Terminology:

1. **Push**: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are *pushed*.
2. **Pop**: Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are *popped*.
3. **Top**: This is the top of the stack.
4. **Peek**: When you `peek` you will view the value of the `top` Node in the stack. When you attempt to `peek` an empty stack and exception will be raised.
5. **isEmpty**: returns true when stack is empty, otherwise returns false.

* **FILO** **F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut: Means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
* **LIFO** **L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut: Means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Big O

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an `O(1)` operations. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes `(n)` you have in the stack.

When adding a Node, you `push` it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its `next` property equal to the original `top`.

Follow the below steps to add a Node.

1.Have the Node you want to add. This is 5, with the value of "gray" and next is null.

> ![First Step to Add Node](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/pushStack1.PNG)

2.Assign next property of Node 5 to reference the same Node that `top` is referencing: `Node 4`

> ![Second Step](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/pushStack2.PNG)

3.At this point, the new Node is added to the stack, but you need to re-assign the reference `top` to the newly added Node, `Node 5`.

> ![Third Step](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/pushStack3.PNG)

4.FIN! Please see the pseuodcode to `push` a value onto a stack:

```json
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```

## Pop

1.First step of removing a Node from stack is to create a reference named `temp` that points to the same Node that `top` points to.

2.Once reference `temp` is created. You now need to re-assign `top` to the value that the `next property is referencing.

> ![Pop, Second Step](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/popStack2.PNG)

3.This allows us to safely remove `Node 5` without it affecting the rest of the stack. Before doing that, we may want to make sure the we clear out the `next` property in our current `temp` reference. This will ensure that no further references to `Node 4` are floating around the heap.

![Pop, third step](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/popStack4.PNG)

4.Finally returning the value of the `temp` Node that was just popped off. Please see below for the pseudocode.

```json
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

* **Peek O(1)**: `return top.value` - peeks at the top value, typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a peek. A try/catch block will work as well.
* **IsEmpty O(1)**: `return top = Null`

## What is a Queue

1. **Enqueue**: Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. **Front**: This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. **Rear**: This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. **Peek**: Whe you `peek` you will view the value of the `front` Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. **IsEmpty**: returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

Queue follows **FIFO** and **LILO**

### Queue Visualization

![Queue Vis](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/Queue.PNG)

### Enqueue O(1)

Does not matter how many other items live in the queue, so it is O(1), as it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

1.First, we change the `next` property of `Node 4` to point to the Node we are adding. This means re-assigning `Node 4's` `.next` to `Node 5`. The only way we have access to `Node 4` is through our reference `rear`. This means that we must change `rear.next` to `Node 5`.

![First Step](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/Enqueue2.PNG)

2.After setting the `next` property, we can re-assign the rear reference to point to `Node 5`. This allows us to keep a reference of where the `rear` is, and we can continue to `enqueue` Nodes into the queue as needed.

![second and last step](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/Enqueue3.PNG)

#### Code

```json
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

### Dequeue O(1)

1.check `isEmpty`, and create a temp reference type named `temp` and have it point to the same Node that `front` is pointing to.

![First](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/Dequeue1.PNG)

2.Re-assign `front` to the `next` value that the Node `front` is referencing.

3.Now we can re-assign the `next` property on the `temp` Node to null.

#### Dequeue Code

```json
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value

```
