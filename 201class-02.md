> Example `#introduction {}`, Targets the element whose id attribute has a value of introduction

### Child Selector
>
> Matches an element that is a direct child of another
>
> Examples `li>a {}`, Targets any `<a>` eleements that are children of an `<li>` elements in the page)

### Descendant Selector
>
> Matches and eleement that is a descendent of another specified element (not just a direct child of that element)
>
> Examples `p a {}`, Targets any `<a>` elements that sit inside a `<p>` eleement, even if there are other elements nested between them

### Adjacent Sibling Selector
>
> Matches an element that is the next sibling of another
>
> Examples `h1+p {}`, Targets the first `<p>` element after any `<h1>` element (but not other `<p>` elements)

### General Sibling Selector
>
> Matches an element that is a sibling of another, although it does not have to be the directly preceding element
>
> Examples `h1~p {}`, If you had two `<p>` elements that are siblings of an `<h1>` element, this rule would apply to both.
