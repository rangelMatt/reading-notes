# Portfolio 4/6/2023

![Portfolio Shot](../Images/Portfolio%20shot.png)

Hey everyone! Checkout my revamped portfolio page!, [here](https://www.mattjrangel.com/)
It's a website showcasing what I've built alongside what I have learned.. It's built with NextJS, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and deployed on Vercel.

On the `Project` page, I'm showcasing 3 recent projects that I have built: Netflix Clone, Weather App, and Gym Website.

This was a lot of fun and I've learned some brilliant technologies that I will be using more of in the near future!

I'll be building out apps, writing articles that I will link there, to help solidify a couple of learning opportunities I identified from building this app and diving deeper into React.

Always looking to grow and expand my skill set as I continue my job search to break into tech, so please reach out as all feedback is genuinely appreciated and helpful.

Best,

Matt Rangel
