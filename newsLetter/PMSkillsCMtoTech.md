There are a lot of similarities between Construction Project Management and Tech Project Management. Moving from the conception of an idea to creating a timeline to make it real. You have to capture a scope and build a budget to show if itâ€™s feasible and if the key stakeholders are interested in building this out and more importantly, if will it sell. Buildings or technology, the levers are the same: time, scope, money.

Iâ€™ve had the advantage of building projects in multiple roles. From a day laborer > carpenter > electrician > project manager and finally and more recently a software developer. I have found that building with tools such as hammers, nails, drills, conduits, and conductors is not much different than building with languages, IDEâ€™s, APIâ€™s, and web development frameworks. In both cases, itâ€™s about learning the tools, the systems, and where to pattern match vs innovate.
When working in the construction field, we would use blueprints to guide SMEs to install in their respective crafts, collaboratively. For example, two installers have two ends of conduit starting from either end of the building to meet in the middle for final connection. Without proper communication, that conduit can be off which can result in a delay in that part of the project and could potentially push the project out of budget.
The same thing applies to Software Development. Especially when it comes to connecting the frontend of the application, the structure and content of web pages or apps, to the backend, the server-side or database, using APIâ€™s as the connecting point. If not properly documented or communicated, there could be assumptions and potential rework, which can provide an increase in schedule and/or budget.

Itâ€™s common for the customer to ask for what they think is small and sometimes it is, but these asks can result in scope creep and we could be looking at a project delay, small or large, depending on the impact of that seemingly small ask. This is where communication comes in and knowledge of the project is crucial. If youâ€™re not deeply aware of how everything connects, you can say yes to something huge.
Both Construction Project Management and Tech Project Manager juggle multiple projects at once, considering the constant ebb and flow of the project life cycle and the overlap of building current projects and scoping potential future projects. They work with stakeholders about potential projects, to see if thereâ€™s enough benefit to the overall company for the team to build. And ongoing projects to share if theyâ€™re going as planned. Which, as a PM you should know that they rarely go exactly as planned. ðŸ˜‰

Both of these seemingly different industries benefit from Project Management, because PMs let the SMEs focus on their respective crafts which removes distractions and allows focus. The PMs create a safety net where the PMO (Project Management Office) flags something that needs to be addressed. This allows the SMEâ€™s have a high level view, while the PMO focuses on making sure the ducks are lined up to be knocked downâ€¦ or something like that.
