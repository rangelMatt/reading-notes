Career Development does not have to be linear.

When I was starting the workforce I was entering with the mindset that once you pick a career path you stick with it. You can stop anywhere you would like along that career path or you climb as high as you like on the ladder, whichever vertical you choose.

It wasn't until I was a 4th year Electrician Apprentice that I met my first career transition.
I was on the 520 bridge in Bellevue, Washington (Go Hawks!) coordinating pulling wires to monitor/control each section of the floating bridge ([also the longest floating bridge in the world at that time!](https://www.enr.com/articles/44013-the-10-longest-floating-bridges-in-the-world)).
I was listening to my tool mate go on and on about the wild life out on the water, again. Although I found it fascinating I wanted to focus on this complex task. I joked and told him he should be an environmental biologist with all that information.

"I was, I have a PHD in Environmental Biology and a BS in Engineering."

He said he chose to get out of that industry because it felt like work, and he didn't want the thing he loved to feel like work, so here he is!

That shifted my perspective. I continued my education toward construction management at University of Washington, where I learned:

- Project Management
- Documentation
- Scope
- Time and Cost Estimation
- Budget Management
- Contract Analysis

Which led me to a Project Management position at a large Construction firm where I sharpened those skills as well as:

- Agile Project Management
- Cross-functional Collaboration
- Change Management
- Resource Optimization
- Stakeholder Engagement
- Data Analytics

After some time in the construction field, I wanted to get into the industry that I began my first career sights on, technology. I began diving head first into Software Engineering, the first career choice I had before getting into construction, where I incorporated what I had learned above as well as:

- Technical Aptitude
- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- Continuous Improvement
- Agile Tools

After the completion of the in depth Certificate path towards Software Development, I began chatting with people in all various verticals in the Tech community and I discovered that `Project Manager` meant different things in different orgs. Also, that there are roles and responsibilities within companies that have PM's that aren't necessarily labeled PM's.
