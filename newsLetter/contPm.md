# Continuing Education in Project Management

Hello Everyone!

After a year of study and self reflection, I’ve found my fire and joy in Project Management. Building on my career in construction project management, layering in my knowledge of building software, I’m now honing my skills through a Project Management certification course by Google.

I’m SO glad I dove back into Software Development to learn SDLC, languages, frameworks, workflows, and the architecture! However just knowing all these things doesn’t make me a good PM in the Tech industry. I’m great because I _want_ to learn and hear people’s unique perspectives. From users, engineers, and designers, the collaboration and explosive creativity helped me discover this cross section where I live and thrive!

I love diving into Google’s course and rekindling that energy! Very excited and thankful to those who have helped me carve my path. And looking forward to those I’ve yet to meet.

I’m also actively looking to join a remote, inclusive, creative team. Please share if you know of any potential fits!
