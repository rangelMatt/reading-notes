Fitness and Technology do not typically go hand in hand. But there are a lot of fitness and technology applications out there that are useful.

There are a few ways fitness enhances my professional life in tech.

One of the ways is getting that body moving helps the blood flow and gets the "rust" out of the brain. It's just like a supercharge to get the brain revving. One of the main reasons why I work out first thing in the morning. I get the hardest thing done first thing in the morning, getting out of the warm bed to do some yoga. I tell myself it's just yoga, cause then the next things are way more difficult, which is lifting heavy and moving quickly. None of these things I REALLY want to do. But the benefits are to hard to ignore. You get a feeling of accomplishment which boost your confidence which in turn boosts how you look at the rest of your day.

During my work in Tech, I am learning new technologies, languages, or meeting with people chatting about real tangible problems that need solving with their companies. These conversations are with various levels of stakeholders with problem such as: how do I get direct reports and people that have influence to accept change, what is the one thing that needs improvement this quarter to move the needle next quarter, as well as, how to communicate with data the thing that's difficult to communicate with data. Initially, I used to get overwhelmed through these conversations, because I just wanted to solve the problem that was brought forth. But then I reigned it in and thoughtfully talked it out. Taking it step by step, movement by movement. You don't get faster or strong after the first workout. You need to get immersed into each rep in each set.
