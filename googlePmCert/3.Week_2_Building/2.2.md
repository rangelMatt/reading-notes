# Utilizing tools to build a project plan

## Developing a project Schedule

> ### An anchor of a good project plan is a clear schedule, containing all the tasks of a project, their owners, and when they need to be completed

Once you have your project schedule, you can build a solid plan around that schedule using tools like spreadsheets and Asana.

There are many helpful tools that you can use to create a project schedule.

> ### Gantt chart
>
> A horizontal bar chart that maps out a project schedule
>
> Highly visual representation of a project's tasks, with clear breakdowns of who's responsible for the work and when those tasks are due.

For example, a Gantt chart, which is a horizontal bar chart that maps out a project schedule. Its a highly visual representation of project tasks with clear breakdowns of who's responsible for the work and when those tasks are due. For many people, a visual aid that builds upon written directions can be a helpful way to understand and synthesize the work they need to do, when they need to complete it, and how their individual tasks connect to the other tasks in a project. Gantt charts are almost like calendars. They feature the start and end dates of each task. and the bars align with how much time is devoted to each of those tasks. For example, let's say that your teammate, Leon, is tasked with creating a project charter and another teammate, Kylie, is tasked with reviewing and editing the charter when Leon is finished.

Using a Gantt chart, you'll use colored bars to illustrate the days that they'll be working on these tasks. With this method, you and the rest of your team can determine that Leon has Friday, Monday, and Tuesday to work on the chart, and Kylie has Wednesday to complete any revisions.

The bars cascade down to illustrate the passing of time and the blocks of time in which the tasks are completed. Gantt charts can be a helpful tool for tracking schedules, but what kinds of tools can you use to make a Gantt chart?

Creating a Gantt chart in a spreadsheet is simple. You can organize your left columns by items like task title, task owner, start date, due date, duration, and percent of task complete. This is a great place to list the tasks and milestones previously identified in a work breakdown structure. You'll include relevant information in the rows below, organized by start date.

On the right side of the sheet, you'll order your columns by the weeks estimated to complete the project from start to finish. In the rows below that, you'll include bars representing the dates when certain tasks will take place. Kind of neat, right? Spreadsheets are helpful here, because they can hold more information than just the Gantt chart.

Though the project schedule serves as the central component of the project plan, you can use separate tabs on your spreadsheet to house or link to other documents you want to include in your plan, like a RACI chart or a project charter. You may also opt to include your plans for risk management and communication here too.

With a spreadsheet, you can simply add a tab for your documents. Keeping every document for the project in one spreadsheet saves time, helps everyone stay organized, and reduces the burden of having to search through emails for information.

Alternatively, you can also opt to use a digital document to link out all of the relevant documents.

While Gantt charts are a useful tool, they are far from the only option for your project plan, and there are plenty of reasons why this form of documentation might now work for you or your project team.

For a simple project, you might find that your team responds better to a digital document that features a list of tables or tasks, their owners, due dates, and links to other relevant planning documents. Or perhaps your team works best with Kanban boards, which uses cards to track and visualize the progress of your tasks.

Regardless of your chosen tool, if your plan includes the project's goals, its tasks, owners, start and end dates, and relevant planning documentation, then you'll be able to keep everyone on the same page.

## Creating a project plan: Tools and templates

**Project plans** are critical because they are used to capture the scope and time it takes to complete a project. The project plan is essentially the project's blueprint-it lays out all of the activities and milestones that your team needs to achieve in order to successfully complete the project. Project plans come in various shapes, sizes, and forms. Depending on the project you are managing, the template you use may very, and some companies even have standard templates they require their project managers to use.

How do you know which tools and techniques to use and when? As a general rule, it is best to use a spreadsheet for a simple project and project management software for a more complex project. Regardless of what tool you use, be sure to include this key information:

- **Task ID numbers** or **task names**: You might end up with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of tasks in a project. Assigning a task ID or name makes it easy to find and reference a task when communicating with team members and stakeholders.
- **Task durations**: A task duration is the amount of time you estimate that task should take. Adding task durations to your project plan helps you organize and prioritize the tasks in the project to help ensure you hit your goal on time.
- **Start and finish dates**: Including start and finish dates for each task helps you track whether you are progressing on time or not.
- **Who is responsible for what**: Including each team member's role and responsibilities helps promote clarity and efficiency. As a best practice, assign an owner to each task, as well.

### **Using a spreadsheet to build a project plan**

Spreadsheets are an excellent tool to use for project plans, particularly for projects that are less complex and that have a clear assignment of tasks. Spreadsheets can require a lot of manual input of information, but as a project manager, you may find that you like the control that spreadsheets provide. Spreadsheets are also customizable, so you can tailor them to your project's needs.

**Pro tip:** It is important to incorporate your **Work Breakdown Structure** numbers into your project plan. In this example, the ID numbers directly relate to the WBS numbers, which is a helpful way to maintain consistency.

### **Spreadsheet templates**

It is helpful to try online tutorials so that you can get used to the different functionalities and user interfaces of each tool. We have included links to some project plan templates below:

### **WOrk management tools**

There are many work management tool options available for you to utilize when planning your project. We covered some of these in previous videos, but as a refresher, it is important to keep in mind that every company, project manager, and customer has a work management tool preference. You may come across tools like [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/), [Asana](https://academy.asana.com/creating-your-first-asana-project/401381), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/basics#step-1-create-a-project), [Trello](https://blog.trello.com/press-play-the-trello-tutorial-video-series-is-here), and many more. These tools allow for collaboration and communication at a task level.

### **Key takeaway: Creating a project plan: Tools and templates**

The tool you use to create your project plan should help you collect and track project details, manage your schedule, and visualize how your project is progressing. A clear, thorough, and organized project plan can help create the recipe for project management success.

## Introduction to Kanban boards

**Kanban boards** are a visual tool used to manage tasks and workflows. Kanban boards can be created on whiteboards, magnetic boards, poster boards, computer programs, and more. Tasks associated with the project are written on cards. These cards are placed in columns, which represent the progress made.

Although Kanban boards are useful for all kinds of projects, they are typically most suitable for project teams working in an **Agile** project management approach. You may remember that Agile project management is an iterative approach to managing projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporates customer feedback with every iteration. Once you become a project manager and have created your project plan, you can decide whether a Kanban board is right for your project.

### **Purposes of a Kanban board**

Kanban boards are used to:

- Give a quick visual understanding of work details and provide critical task information.
- Facilitate handoffs between stakeholders, such as between development and testing resources or between team members who work on related tasks.
- Help with capturing metrics and improving workflows.

### **Using a Kanban board**

Before creating a board, it is best practice to gather the necessary information and lay out key elements, such as tasks, status, dates, and durations. That information is useful when building your board.

Let's turn our focus to an example of a Kanban board below. Each colored rectangle is associated with a task. The tasks are represented horizontally across the effort timeline. Each column represents where the task is in relation to its completion. So as a task is started, it will move from _to do_, to _in progress_. When the project is almost ready to be released or complete, it will move to _testing_, and when it is tested and approved, it will move to _done_. Note that this is just one example of a Kanban board, and depending on the tool you use-such as software or a physical board-you can customize your board using various columns and cards. The board can also have rows for resources (team or person), to help visualize who is actively working on what.

### **Creating cards**

Cards will vary in style-you can even use sticky notes on a whiteboard-but most cards will contain a few key details about the task that they represent. When using physical cards, teams often use both sides. Here is what both sides of the should include:

#### **Front**

- **Title and unique identifier**: Make sure you have a quick reference for tasks and ID numbers.
- **Description of work**: Briefly describe the task to be accomplished. Remember that this is intended to be captured on something no larger than an index card.
- **Estimation of effort**: Estimate the amount of work it will take to complete the task. For example, you can write "small", "medium", or "large" to indicate the level of effort you think that this task will involve.
- **Who is assigned to the task**: Indicate who is responsible for completing the task; ideally, one person per card.

#### **Back**

- **Start date**: Include the start date of the task for use in metrics, tracking, and ensuring that your time estimate is accurate.
- **Blocked days**: Indicate which days your task may be halted. A task can become blocked if it _it can't continue to be worked on_. For example, if you were supposed to receive a deliverable and it hasn't been delivered yet, then your day may be blocked for this particular task.
- **Finish date**: As with any plan, it is important to track when the task is supposed to be finished. This allows you to ensure that your project is still on track to reach the end goal.

### **Kanban board software**

If you opt to use a software tool rather than a physical board, you have a few options.

There are many options, so take the time to evaluate which is best for you and your project.
