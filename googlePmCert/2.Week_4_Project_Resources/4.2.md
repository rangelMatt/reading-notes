# The value of project documentation

It's your job to keep track of every new decision and use those decisions to create a plan, even if you're not the one making final decisions on major aspects of the project. There are lot of important decisions to keep track of, including everything from identifying project goals and deliverables to choosing the right people to add to a team. It's way to much for any one person to mentally keep track of.

It's also important information for everyone on the team to be aware of; not just the project manager. If a decision affects a member of the team's task, they'll eed to know about it, right? That's why documentation is such an important part of a project' manager's role. While your team may work deeply on specific areas of the project, you might be the only person on the team who is aware of and communicating across all the different areas of the project.

> ## Clear and consistent documentation can ensure transparency and clear communication

Documentation helps set the stage for the project. It communicates the answers to key questions. For example:

- What problem are you trying to solve?
- What are the project goals?
- What are the scope and deliverables?
- Who are the project's stakeholders?
- What resources does the team need to complete their work?

This is all crucial information for anyone who's working on a project, regardless of their role. Documentation also helps preserve decisions made early on in the project and can serve as a reference point for team members who might join later in the project life cycle. It's your job to ensure that this information is easily accessible through some kind of formal documentation, like an e-mail, a presentation, or a digital document.

> ### Documenting decisions can help you uncover tasks, timelines, or costs

Documenting decisions can help you uncover tasks, timelines, or costs you hadn't previously considered. And lastly, this process provides a historical record that can be reviewed at the end of your project. You can apply the lessons you've learned in the future.

# Project proposals and charters 101

Two common types of documentation you could use to keep track of details and keep your stakeholders informed. These are: the project proposal and the project charter.

> ## Project proposal
>
> A form of documentation that persuades a stakeholder to begin a project

A project proposal is a form of documentation that comes at the very beginning of the project. This document's purpose is to persuade stakeholders that a project should begin. And typically, a senior organizational leader creates the proposal. So you might not need to worry about creating the proposal, but you will have to keep track of the proposal's progress.

The project proposal is a great starting point to help you understand the desired goals and impact. A proposal may be a formal document, a presentation, or even a simple email to get others on board with the idea.

> ## Project charter
>
> A formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach its goals.

A project charter helps you get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done, and communicate those details to others. A project proposal is created earlier in the project life cycle than the project charter. The proposal kicks off the initiation phase by influencing and persuading the company to move forward with the project.

> ## The project proposal kicks off the initiation phase by influencing and persuading the company to move forward with the project.

The project charter serves a similar purpose and often comes at the end of the initiation phase. However, its goal is to more clearly define the key details of the project.

> ## The project charter's goal is to more clearly define the key details of the project.

Another difference between these two documents is that a charter will often serve as a point of reference throughout the life of a project. The proposal is only used at the earlier stages.

> ## The project charter makes clear that the benefits of the project outweigh the costs of the project

The project charter makes clear that the benefits of the project outweigh the costs. As you learned earlier in this course, there are a few questions you might ask yourself when performing a cost benefit analysis. That includes questions like:

## Cost Benefit Analysis

- Business value created
  - What value will this project create?
- Money saved
  - How much money could this project save my organization?
- Time invested
  - How much time will people have to spend on this project?

You'll include the answers to these questions in your charter. Including this type of information ensure that you and your stakeholders agree on the project value.

> ## Project charters also helps ensure that you and your stakeholders agree on the details of the project

The charter also helps ensure that you and your stakeholders agree on the details of the project. Project charter approval means that management is supportive, and it's also a key step to ensure that the project matches the needs of the organization. After the stakeholders and project sponsor have reviewed and approved the project charter, you now have the authority to move forward with the project. Project charters can be formatted in a few ways and can contain different information depending on the project and the organization. The information in a charter might also be tailored to its audience or the needs of specific stakeholders. For example, if your writing a project charter for a stakeholder who is a marketing executive, the charter might include information about how the project will impact the organization's brand. Or if the stakeholder is a chief technology officer, the charter might include information on the cost of engineering resources needed to maintain the project.

> ## Creating a project charter is a best practice to ensure that everyone agrees on how to move forward before entering the planning phase

Regardless of the format or the audience, creating a project charter is a best practice to ensure that everyone agrees on how to move forward before entering the planning phase. The project charter is a living document.

This means that it can evolve as the project progresses. As the project manager, you'll review and refine the charter throughout the process.

# Project charters: Elements and formats

A **project charter** clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details for the project to reach its goals. A well documented project charter can be a project manager's secret weapon to success. In this reading, we will go over the function, key elements, and significance of a project charter and learn how to create one.

The charter is the formal way that the project's goals, values, benefits, and details are captured. You can think of the charter as the compass for your project since you will use it throughout the life cycle of the project. Many stakeholders will look to your project charter to ensure that you are indeed aligned with strategic goals and set up for achieving the desired end goal. Since the project charter carries so much importance, it is important to incorporate the right amount of detail while omitting miscellaneous elements.

As with any of your project documents, it is a good idea to collaborate with your team and stakeholders early and often. Developing the project charter in collaboration with both groups can help you make sure that your project charter addresses your key stakeholders' most important concerns and keeps your team aligned. Be sure to use the business case-the reason for initiating the project-as the guiding direction to your project charter. Project charters can very from organization to organization and from project to project. It is key for a project manager to identify the best type of charter for the project in order to capture the relevant information and set your project up for success.

Project charters will vary but usually include some combination of the following key information:

- introduction/project summary
- goals/objectives
- business case/benefits and costs
- project team
- scope
- success criteria
- major requirements or key deliverables
- budget
- schedule/timeline or milestones
- constraints and assumptions
- risks
- OKRs
- approvals

You will likely use many different project charter formats throughout your project management career. One example is a condensed, simplified document, like the one you'll learn about in the upcoming video and the one linked in the activities. A short and simple project charter can be used on smaller projects that are not very complex.

![Project Charter Document example](/Images/charter-doc-example.jpeg)

For more complex projects, you may link to additional analysis or documents. You can house these items in the appendix.

Your organization may have a unique template for you to use, or you may have the flexibility to leverage one you come across in your career. As your project progresses, you may also encounter revisions to your project charter-and that is okay. Remember, it is a living document; let it grow with your project, and **review and revisit it often** to ensure you are aligned.

# Developing a project charter

Project charters are key for securing approval from stakeholders and moving forward. Project charters can also be formatted in many different ways and there are many different templates available online for you to choose from. Here, we'll use a template that's similar to one that program managers often use at Google and to fill in each section will use details from the project at Office Green.

At the tope of your charter, you'll want to add in the name of your project. Let's add in the name of your project at Office Green, it's called:

- `Project Plant Pals`.

You also want to add in a brief summary:

- `Our plan is to offer high volume customers, small, low maintenance plants that can thrive in an office environment.`

Now, lets fill in the section labeled "project goals." Remember that goals should be **SMART**. Let's add in the goal for Project Plant Pals:

- `increase revenue by 5% by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to top clients by the end of the year.`

Now, lets add in the project deliverable. Remember that a deliverable is a tangible outcome from a project. As you learned earlier, our deliverables for this project:

- `Send 1000 plants to 100 customers`
- `To launch a new website for orders and customer support.`

Now lets add in the business case, which captures the reasoning for initiating this project. Let's type in:

- `This is a top requested service from our customers and it will also improve customer satisfaction and retention.`

The business case is supported by the cost benefit analysis and we'll add that in now. We'll start with the benefits. The benefits or expected gains of the project:

- `improving customer satisfaction`
- `increase in revenue.`

Now, we'll move onto costs. The costs include:

- `Sourcing products`
- `Developing a website`
- `Marketing materials.`

Estimated budget:

- `$250,000`

Now we have outlined some of the benefits and costs for this project.

Keep in mind that these are simple examples to teach the basics of filling out a charter. When running a real project, you'll perform a more detailed analysis to determine the benefits and costs.

The key takeaway here:

> Benefits should always outweigh the cost.

Next, we're going to add in the project scope as well as what's considered out of scope for this project. Remember scope is an agreed upon understanding of what is included or excluded from a project.

An item that is in scope:

- `Creating a service to deliver small plants to last year's top clients`

Out of Scope:

- `Plant care after they're delivered.`

Amazing. Hopefully you can see how stating what's in scope and what's out of scope helps everyone working on the project understand where they should focus their efforts.

Now let's add in the project team.

Project sponsor:

- `Director of product`

Project lead:

- `Matt Rangel`

Project team:

- `Marketing associates`
- `Website developers`
- `External plant vendors`

Additional stakeholders:

- `VP, customer success`
- `Account Manager`
- `Fulfillment Manager`

Additional stakeholders could include; VP, customer success who is accountable for customer feedback and corresponding product requests. We can also add in the account manager who will leverage their existing relationships with top clients. And let's also add in the fulfillment manager, who will help acquire the plants needed to launch the service.

Finally, lets add in how we'll measure success. Here we will type in that we want to see a 5% increase in revenue by the end of the year. Let's also type in that we want to hit a customer satisfaction rate of 95%, 3 months after launch.

Measuring Success:

**What is acceptable**:

- `5% revenue increase by EOY`
- `95% customer satisfaction rate, 3 months after launch`

That's it. The project charter is filled in and now it's ready to be reviewed by your stakeholders. Now you're done. You've seen how documentation helps for the roots of a project and how it contributes to the projects ultimate success. Like nurturing a plant, you're learning to nurture a project to ensure its the best it can be.
