# Evaluating tools to meet project needs

## Utilizing tools for effective project management

As a project manager, tools are some of the most helpful resources you have at your disposal. They're essential for tracking progress, so its important to keep them top of mind throughout the entire project.

There are lots of different tools out there, and you'll learn more about them later. As a reminder, tools are aids that make it easier for a project manager or team to manage resources and organize work.

> Tools can help track detailed information about all kinds of tasks and make it easy to communicate with lots of different people.

They're useful because they can help you track details information about all kinds of tasks, and they make it easy to communicate with lots of different people. Effective communication and tracking are huge parts of a project manager's day-to-day responsibilities. The project manager job would be much tougher without help from collaboration tools like e-mail or digital documents created in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Let's imagine this in the context of our project at Office Green. As a lead project manager, you have tons of information about the company's plan to provide office-friendly plants to top clients. But what would happen if you wrote every project detail ona whiteboard instead of a shared online document? Every member of your team would have to stop by your desk to get the latest information, and that's definitely not the most efficient use of anyone's time. But if you store this information in easily-accessible online documents, you save everyone on the team time, energy, and a major headache.

Today's tools have made it so much easier to share information with teammates. Even better with project management tools, information sharing goes both ways. That means team members can also easily update you on their progress without the need for extra meetings or phone calls. How great is that?

> ## Project management tools help you
>
> - Track task deadlines
> - Provide visibility to others
> - Manage a budget
> - Create helpful diagrams
> - Manage contracts

When you choose the right tool for a project, you make it easy for teammates to let you know if a task is on schedule or if it's delayed, which lets you quickly see how any changes might affect the rest of the project. Project management tools increase visibility and transparency for everyone, including stakeholders. You can use a variety of tools to accomplish many different things, like tracking progress on tasks, deliverables, and milestones. Tools can also help you manage a budget, build helpful charts and diagrams, manage contracts and licenses, and keep stakeholders informed. Tools can be straightforward, like digital spreadsheets or documents, or they can be more sophisticated, like scheduling and work management software. It's important to think about the needs of the project when choosing which to use.

One thing to keep in mind is that if you choose a more sophisticated tool, your teammates and stakeholders will need some time to get familiar with it. For small projects, that might be more trouble than it's worth. So for small projects, a straight forward tool might be more effective. But if a project has a big scope, then it might be worth the team's time to learn and ultimately work with a more sophisticated project management tool.

You should also keep in mind that sometimes you won't have a choice about the types of tools you use. If an organization has already decided to use a specific tool, then you will need to work with what they give you. It's all about remaining flexible.

## Introducing new tools to a team

Project management tools and process are always evolving. In this reading, we will discuss the importance of choosing the right tools for a project and the implications of introducing new tools to your team.

As a project manager, it is important to be open to implementing new tools that may be beneficial to a project's outcome. You will experience change in lots of forms throughout your project's life cycle, and navigating change is essential. But if you choose to implement a tool that your team is unfamiliar with-especially if you decide to roll it out midway through a project-your team may be hesitant. People embrace change differently, particularly if the change will directly impact their routine and the way they work. Simply put: Change can be met with resistance.

Before you introduce a new tools to your team, you should be sure that this change is actually going to benefit the project, and ensure that those involved in your project understand the benefits of this change. Demonstrating to your teammates and stakeholders that you understand the tools and have evaluated its competency will help build trust, especially if this new tools is replacing an existing tool. Taking the time to introduce the new tools to your team members will also demonstrate that you have the best interest of the team in mind-not just the success of the project.

Here are some important considerations and keys to successfully introducing new tools:

- **Discuss the tool early and often, if possible**. The team should not feel blindsided by a new change. Make sure they know the change is coming as early as possible. This will help them prepare for an introduction or migration to the new tools.
- **Ask for feedback from key stakeholders.** You could get great feedback on features that you may have overlooked without asking for their expertise. You can solicit this feedback by requesting their input about functionality or have them list features in order of priority. The key is to create an opportunity for stakeholders to provide their feedback and allow you to incorporate their feedback into next steps.
- **Involve the key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the project tracking tool.** You will be able to leverage key stakeholders' acceptance by letting them test the product or sign up for a trial run. It is also important to make sure that the tools is actually going to meet the mark and provide a meaningful change for the project. You may want to pull in key users from your team to test and familiarize themselves with the tool prior to rolling it out. This will allow the team to get on board with your plans or discuss their concerns beforehand. This will also highlight in-house experts for future training, assistance, and implementation.
- **Ensure the tool is fully functional before the team is introduced to it.** Whenever possible, hold off from introducing the tool if it still has any issues. Make sure the tool is accessible for all users. Keep in mind, your team members may resist a tool that doesn't live up to how it is supposed to function. This will impact implementation and acceptance fairly significantly, so put your best tool forward!
- **Set up training for the tool as needed before you ask the team to actually use it.** Everyone has different levels of comfort with different tools. It is your job as the project manager to ensure that each team members' needs are addressed. Setting up training also helps create positive first impressions, which will lead to higher productivity and quicker, more successful implementation and acceptance.

Remember, some push back is normal, but successful project managers should take the steps to prepare and mitigate any friction for their team when possible.

**Pro tip:** If time allows, plan for a period of transition if you are replacing an existing tool. It is common to allow both tools to operate during this period. You will need to "sunset", or retire, the existing tool eventually, but allowing for a period of transition between using the old tool and the new tool can help stakeholders and team members feel more at ease and give them time to gain familiarity with the new tool. Be prepared for productivity to be impacted as the team transitions from one tool to another.

## Exploring types of project management tools

Different types of tools used in project management. These include scheduling and work management software and tools for productivity and collaboration. One common tool type is scheduling and work management software. There are lots of different types of work management software on the market, including popular tools like these.

|               Asana               |                 Jira                 |
| :-------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
| ![Asana Logo](/Images/asana.jpeg) | ![Jira Logo](/Images/jira_logo.jpeg) |

Certain tools may work better for your project depending on a bunch of things; for example, the project methodology you're running or the number of tasks and people involved. Why would you choose to use scheduling and work management software? Well, it can be really useful for assigning tasks to multiple teammates and for tracking progress on that work. It can also help you visualize your team's progress. For example, if you're using work management software to assign and track tasks, you're more likely to notice if your team completes 50 tasks one week and just three tasks the following week. That's a clear sign that you need to check in to see if there's a problem that's blocking progress. If you hadn't been tracking their tasks, you might not have noticed the issue. That's part of the reason why work management software is so useful. It provides an overview of how the project is going so you know when you need to check in with your teams to get tasks back on track.

> ### Productivity & collaboration tools
>
> - Online shared documents
> - Meeting agendas
> - Status updates
> - Spreadsheets
> - RACI charts
> - Project plans
> - Presentations
> - Project Overviews
> - Email and chat

Another type of project management tools we'll discuss is tools for productivity. Productivity tools can be very helpful for you and your team. This includes word processing tools, like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. You can use these to create shared documents with the team, like the project charter we taught you how to fill out earlier. You can also use these tools to build documents like meeting agendas and status updates, and we'll talk more about these in a later course.

Spreadsheets are another useful productivity tool. They're versatile, and you can use them to make documents, like RACI charts and project plans, as well as other helpful charts you'll learn more about ina later course.

Presentations created in tools, like Microsoft PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides can be a great way to package your project ina visual, easily-digestible way. Now, let's discuss collaboration tools, which you'll probably rely on to work closely with your teammates. These include tools you're probably familiar with, like email and chat. Tools like this can help you quickly and efficiently check in with each other on questions, comments, and other topics related to the project.

Productivity tools like documents and spreadsheets, and collaboration tools like email and chat, are all pretty simple, which means they're great for smaller projects with fewer tasks and teammates to keep track of. Scheduling and work management software is better for bigger projects with a larger number of tasks and a bigger team of people to manage.

## Common project management tools

A few popular tools you might be expected to use, or at least be familiar with. There are many different types of work management software that automatically make project planning and tracking a lot easier and that are much more efficient than manual project tracking. One tool that we'll focus on in this program is Asana. Asana is a work management platform that helps teams plan and coordinate their work from daily tasks to strategic initiatives. Asana provides a living system and a source of truth where everyone's work lives. With Asana, everyone can see, discuss, and manage team priorities, giving teams clarity on who is doing what by when. It's great for building project plans, assigning tasks, automating workflows, tracking progress, and communicating with stakeholders. As a project manager, you can use Asana to create a log of tasks, like gathering cost estimates from external vendors, and assign a task to people on the team. All tasks are visible and organized in the format of the project manager's choice-like in a list or on a calendar-and designed to drive transparency and connection with all the tasks related to the overall goal. It's easy to use with external stakeholders as well, because within Asana, you can share status updates and other communications with people outside your company. Another great tool we'll focus on throughout this program is the spreadsheet. Spreadsheets are extremely versatile, and you can use them for a wide range of tasks, from creating timelines and billing charts to managing budgets and tracking tasks. You can add an view project information in a variety of formats, depending on what you need in the moment. For example, let's say you enter a list of tasks, due dates, completion statuses, and task owners into a spreadsheet. From there, it's very simple to sort the list by due date to see what's due next.

You can then filter the list of tasks by task owner, so that you only see the things you're responsible for.

You can also highlight the rows of the sheet in different colors to visually illustrate the tasks with the least progress. With spreadsheets, you can easily transform, visualize, and manipulate information. Spreadsheets and more comprehensive tools like Asana are just two options for effective project management, and its a good idea to get a basic understanding of the variety of software options out there. Then, if your company doesn't have a standard software tool, you can choose the right one for the project needs. Being able to recommend the right tool for the job can be a great way to add value to your team at the beginning of a project. Keep in mind, however, that software options are constantly changing. From the addition of new features to the launch of new tools, there's no way for you to know every software available, and no company would expect that of you. Many of these tools have similar functionality, like task tracking and task assignment, so if you understand one tool deeply, you should be able to easily adapt to a new tool on the job.

## Using Google Sheets for project management

### Essential Sheets features for project management

#### **Collaborate with your team**

Google Sheets makes it easy to collaborate and share information. This is useful for remote workgroups or working with teams that heave different schedules.

When you share your Sheet, you can select from the following permissions:

- **editing,** which allows others to make direct edits and changes to the file;
- **commenting,** which allows others to add comments and make suggestions; or
- **view only,** which allows others to view the file but not edit, comment, or suggest. This is a good choice if you don't want any changes to be made to the file.

Once you've shared your Sheet with your team and given them either editing or commenting permissions, you can all collaborate directly in the Sheet by leaving comments. You can also assign a task or action item through comments.

Share and collaborate on file [resource](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494822?hl=en&visit_id=638236631040058470-1349771575&rd=1).

#### **Format your spreadsheet**

##### **Create lists**

To create any list in Sheets, simply label each list-for example, Name, Date, Notes, or other criteria-in the **header row**. (The header row is the top row in the spreadsheet.) Then, add a different list item in each cell underneath the list title. Most lists are arranged vertically, but you might prefer a horizontal list depending on the types of items. _Note: You'll learn how to build out a full project plan and prioritize tasks later in this course._

##### **Display and hide content**

##### **Freeze rows or columns**

Freezing the header row (or column for horizontal lists) and formatting headers is a great way to make the list titles stand out. Freezing a header row keeps the row in place when you scroll down the list, so you can always see what the list titles are. Format the headers just like you would text in a document by changing the font, style, size, or color.

##### **Group and hid related content**

Grouping rows and columns allows you to expand and collapse larger categories of data or information with a single click. This makes your spreadsheet easier to read and manage by hiding the grouped data when it's not needed, or quickly ungroup and show it is needed.

- [Google Sheets cheat sheet](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9300022?hl=en)

##### **Add checkboxes**

Checkboxes provide a quick and highly-visual way to track progress on a task or indicate whether certain criteria have been met.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Add checkboxes to spreadsheets](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7684717?hl=en&ref_topic=9326428&visit_id=638236631042078693-1299334641&rd=1)

#### **Organize data**

##### **Create dropdown lists**

If you're working with others on a shared Sheet, you might end up with inconsistent responses or descriptions of data. For example, one teammate may list their task as "done" while another notes it as "complete". Adding a dropdown list (also referred to as **data validation**) ensures the data entered into your spreadsheet is exactly what you specify. It also makes it much faster for others to add data since they're selecting from a predetermined list of options.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Restrict data entry with lists](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9604139?hl=en#zippy=%2Clearn-how)

##### **Add color coding**

Sometimes it's helpful to change the color of cells and text so you can quickly see how your project is progressing. You can add color coding to your spreadsheet by applying **conditional formatting.** Conditional formatting formats cells in a certain way if they contain specific information. For example, track progress status as "Not started" in red, "In progress" in orange, and "Complete" in green.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [See data changes with conditional formatting](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/186103?hl=en&ref_topic=9327402&visit_id=638236631042078693-1299334641&rd=1)

##### **Sort and filter data**

Large sets of data can be difficult to manage. Sheets helps you sort and filter data to limit what is visible and find specific types of data within your spreadsheet.

**Sorting** data allows you to arrange data in exactly the order you want it to appear in, like alphabetical, by date, or progress level. **Filtering** limits what data gets displayed and shows you only the data you are interested in, such as tasks that have not yet been started, or budget items with in a certain value range.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Filter data in a spreadsheet](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681?hl=en&visit_id=638236631042078693-1299334641&rd=1)

##### **Add links**

It can be helpful to link to other project documentation or even external websites in your spreadsheet. This provides your team easy, centralized access to all relevant data they might need. For example, you could add a link to your project charter document from your project plan spreadsheet.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_**

- [Use links](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/45893?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en#zippy=%2Ccreate-a-link)

#### **Visualize data**

##### **Create a pivot table**

A **pivot table** is a basic data analysis tool. Pivot tables summarize your data and can help show the relationships between data points, making it easier to understand all the information contained in your spreadsheet. You'll learn more about how to create and use a pivot table later in this course. Or, check out the Help Center article below.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Create and edit pivot tables](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1272900?hl=en&visit_id=638236631042078693-1299334641&rd=1)

##### **Make a chart or graph**

Presenting data in charts and graphs is a great way to quickly and effectively summarize important information about your project to stakeholders and make reports and presentations more engaging. Sheets enables you to automatically create different kinds of charts and graphs using the data in your spreadsheet.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Insert and edit charts](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63824?hl=en&visit_id=638236631042078693-1299334641&rd=1)

#### **Perform calculations**

##### **Use functions**

**Functions** can be used to manipulate data and perform calculations. Google Sheets has a wide array of functions that are already built in, which means they will automatically perform the calculations your specify. Use functions to quickly calculate sums or averages, automatically determine start or end dates, generate financial reports, and much more.

- [Google Sheets cheat sheet](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9300022?hl=en)

### Useful spreadsheet templates

#### **Using spreadsheet templates for project management**

Creating the same types of spreadsheets over and over can be time-consuming. You can save time by using templates such as those available from the [Google Sheets template gallery](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/?ftv=1&folder=0AKrj08N1UHZqUk9PVA&tgif=c). Choose from a variety of pre-made spreadsheets for budgets, schedules, and trackers, or create your own!

Some of the more common templates are described and linked below. To use the templates for these course items, click the links below and select "Use Template":

- [Project Timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Us-j-BAG3kiIJENBt3SqRXkJQL_TZh-yejJyZzq9L60/template/preview#gid=1709744959): A project timeline template is useful if you want to track an entire project from conception to close. This example includes a visual timeline that lays out the life cycle of a project and the major activities that need to happen during each phase. You'll learn more about creating and tracking a project timeline later in the course and get to experience working with your own project timeline templates.
- [Project Tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12AK5slxygSxj8nmjS39SCnEFkCy8WZDbgN0vSQh2xwg/template/preview?resourcekey=0-__sqaWcGZavYWgXz-WD4jQ#gid=1161341563): A project tracking template is useful for tracking your project's budget, deliverables, and other data. This example includes columns for tracking costs and time, as well as a column with dropdown lists for tracking tasks' priority levels. Other features include formulas for calculating hours, costs, and percentage of deliverables completed, which allow you to track your spending and progress on a project.
- [Gantt Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yc1KA_7DMwBqyt2Zcx68HAV3oEp1FnUt-undm0XHgqM/template/preview?resourcekey=0-y-3VgQEbmAVaiEGfeyeJ-g#gid=1115838130): A Gantt chart combines many of the aspects of other types of project management spreadsheets into one. It organizes tasks by day and is useful for showing the relationships between the many moving parts of a project. It's also helpful for managing a project with multiple collaborators. Gantt charts often include conditional formatting that makes cells change color based on how far along the project is so you can immediately determine how much progress you have made on a particular task.
- [Event Marketing Timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10GindXMsW6z0pFvd5Ymjz_PS0dXJ5eCkl3KDKEPO9qY/template/preview#gid=541890420): A timeline template is useful for creating a schedule, tracking events, and visualizing the tasks and milestones involved in a project. You might use this template to manage a project that involves a lot of marketing or public-facing tasks. You can track social media posts, market research, and coordinate content across multiple platforms.

## Demonstrating your knowledge of project management tools

During an interview for a project manager position the interviewer may ask you to discuss the project management tools you are familiar with or have used in the past. There are many types of project management tools that you will come across during your career. These tools will continue to grow and change as technology improves. Being able to talk about these tools, and how you use them, will be crucial to landing the role.

In addition to the interviewer asking general questions about tools, they may ask more specific questions, like "How do you know if a project is off track?" It's important to tie this answer back to the types of scheduling tools you have learned about in this course. If you haven't had experience working with certain scheduling tools, like SmartSheet or digital spreadsheets-try to leverage real-life experience.

For example, have you ever planned for a move? If so, you can discuss how you planned your timeline and scheduled vendors so that you could meet your move date. Did you use a spreadsheet to keep track of your budget, schedule, and belongings? This experience demonstrates you understand how to use tools. It also demonstrates that you know the importance of creating, monitoring, and managing the project schedule to deliver results at project completion.

Another related question the interviewer may ask could be, "How do you execute tasks within your timeline?" This is a great opportunity to demonstrate your ability to be productive by sharing your experience with tools, such as digital documents or spreadsheets. These tools help you create project artifacts, track tasks, and store project details in one place! You can also use them as a collaboration tool because they are easily shareable with teammates and stakeholders and allow for real-time updates.

Finally, there are special project management tools, also called work management tools, that put all the benefits discussed above into one place. Project management tools such as Asana, Monday.com, Basecamp, and Trello are among some of the top ranked tools for managing projects. These tools help you plan, track, and complete work across many project phases. They often have visually appealing layouts and automated features that save time and create efficiency in a project manager's day-to-day tasks. Explaining your knowledge of these tools-and how they benefit the project manager, team, and company-in an interview is a great way to demonstrate that you are qualified for the role.

**Pro tip:** Learn more by trying free tutorials or trial versions of popular management tools. By navigating project management software, you will be able to explain the uses and functionality of these types of tools firsthand. Here are some examples to get started:

- [Asana](https://asana.com/) and [Asana Guide](https://asana.com/guide)
- [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/en)

## Build a project management tool tracker

As you progress through this course, you will learn about different types of tools used by project managers and the organizations that hire them. Tools can include software applications like Adobe, Google, and Microsoft and specific work management tools like Jira and Asana. They can also include methodologies, techniques, formulas and concepts, and technologies related to project management.

This reading provides step-by-step instructions for creating a tracker for all of these types of tools. You can use your tracker to list the different tools you learn about, their descriptions and links, their features and benefits, and your level of experience with each. This way, you can easily identify the tools required for different roles and determine where you might want to focus your professional development efforts.

## Amar: Tools are our best friends

What to look at is what tools will help me create the body of work. Find tools that help create body of work, like Jira and ALM. These will help you define what needs to be delivered and when. This will help create the time line.

Then find timeline tools, like Gantt Chart and Tools.

Want to make sure that what are the current tools which are out there. Find out what tools are supported and what are the current adoption rate. Look at the gaps, and if there are gaps, go for new tools. Propose new tools to improve productivity. But if there is an existing tool set which the team is following, try to learn those tools because those are the tools which will get quick adoption, and those will be an amazing tools to have with you.
