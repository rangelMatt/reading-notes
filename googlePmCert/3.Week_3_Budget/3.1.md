## The importance of budget setting

Project budgeting is a lot like personal budgeting, except a little more complex.

> ### Project budget
>
> The estimated monetary resources needed to achieve the project's goals and objectives

When reviewing a project budget, you need to consider all of the potential and projected costs needed to complete the project.

> ### Milestone
>
> An important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project

Break the budget down by milestones, which are important points within the project that indicate progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project, and list activities and tasks alongside their associated costs.

> ### Forecast
>
> A cost estimate, or prediction over a period of time

This ensures that you calculate the correct expenses for a particular period of time. This is considered a forecast. A forecast for your project budget is a cost estimate or a prediction over a period of time. You'll frequently review your project budget and it will evolve throughout the project life cycle. These budgets usually contain items such as labor, operating costs and costs associated with obtaining necessary materials like hardware, software, or equipment. The importance of a project budget focuses on more than just saving money. In project management, a budget is considered a deliverable. It is a success metric. the project budget is a tool to communicate exactly what is needed and when it is needed with stakeholders.

> Budget creation takes place in the initiation phase of your project

The budget will have a direct effect on the company's financial viability. So, as you can probably tell by now, it's an integral part of project management. Budget creation takes place in the initiation phase of your project. Keep in mind that the budget will be adjusted as needed throughout the lifecycle of the project. Depending on your role in the company, you won't always be the sole creator of the budget.

Your ownership over things like budget and vendor relationship may vary depending on factors such as size of the company or support team or the team organizational chart. Although you may not always manage the budget from start to finish, budget and milestones go hand in hand. So it's important for you to know the ins and outs of the budget throughout the project. As a project manager, you may be tasked with obtaining approvals for spending. Most companies have a signing or spending policy. This usually outlines who has the authority to commit resources or incur costs or other obligations on behalf of the company.

This is important because you won't be able to continue with some of your deliverables or action items, if you don't know how much certain activities will cost, and whether you have the necessary funds available. It wouldn't make any sense to rent a property without checking on the rental cost first, right? That's especially true if the rental price is higher than your budget. The same thinking is applicable for your project budgeting.

> The budgeting process usually happens in conjunction with the scheduling process

The budgeting process usually happens in conjunction with the scheduling process because the steps of the scheduling process are highly dependent on the costs. The project manager will collaborate with people on the project to create their estimations. For the most part, after the cost estimating process has been completed, it's common for the project sponsor or another key stakeholder to review and approve estimation costs, and if necessary adjust and reallocate funds for the project. This could mean that either the CEO or the COO are the ones giving the okay or the final sign-off.

For example, in our Office Green project, the director of product has sign-off approval. As we mentioned before, the project manager will most likely need some kind of sign-off from the finance department. This may very from company to company. So just make sure you're aware of your company's processes. Project budgeting is never a one-size-fits-all operation. As the project manager, you will have to prioritize where you allocate funds within the project to ensure maximum output.

> Most projects are created to:
>
> - Increase workforce productivity
> - Increase revenue
> - Attempt to save costs

Ultimately, most projects are created to improve workforce productivity, increase revenue, or attempt to save costs within an organization. BUdgeting is one of the most important aspects of project management, and when you start, to stay on budget is one of the trickiest tasks. It's important not to go over budget and cost the company extra money, and it's equally important not to be under budget either since that might affect the company's budget for the next year. When it comes to high-profile businesses, such as publicly traded companies like Google, or public sector organizations such as your local education department, they may have a requirement to report on their financial performance to shareholders or auditors. Going to far over or under budget will change the way the company budgets for the next year, potentially leaving you with less money to work with in the future.

> A project manager must show the requested amount of money was used in order to secure enough budget for future projects

In other words, a project manager must show the requested amount of money was used in order to secure enough budget for future projects. For small businesses, there may be a tighter budget, in which case it's especially critical to be careful about spending too much money on a project than initially allocated. It's really helpful to your overall success as a project manager to understand budgeting.

## Key components of a project budget

> ### When creating a budget, a project manager must account for
>
> - Understanding stakeholder needs
> - Budgeting for surprise expenses
> - Maintaining adaptability
> - Reviewing and reforecasting throughout the project

There are so many things to factor into project budgeting. Project managers must account for understanding stakeholder needs, budgeting for surprise expenses, maintaining adaptability, and reviewing and reforecasting throughout the entire project. For example, in Office Green, it's important to know exactly what stakeholders expect from this project in order to deliver. As a company, the ultimate goal is typically to make a profit and to save money and time. The project sponsor-the Director of Product, in this case-needs the project to come in at a certain cost in order to make profit. As the project manager, you will also need to budget for surprise expenses. Let's say several planters arrive from the vendor broken and cracked. Maybe the planter is cracked during delivery process, and it isn't the vendors fault. In that case, you will have to order some additional planters to fulfill orders, and that may be an added cost. As your project continues along, you'll have to review your budget and sometimes reforecast, which means creating a separate revised budget based on how your project is tracking. Keeping on top of the budget will help you stay organized, and reforecasting is a way to recalibrate the budget, if necessary. as the project manager Office Green, you might find that you need to shift costs to different resources and categories within your project budget. Maybe you initially overestimated the cost of plants from the vendor and underestimated the costs of marketing your new launch. You can reallocate these dollars as necessary. That's a great example of how to review and reforecast.

> ### Resource cost rates
>
> The cost of a resource

There are several factors to consider when creating a budget, including resource cost rates, reserve analysis, contingency budget, and cost of quality. You'll need to determine resource cost rates. Resource cost rates are exactly what they sound like, the cost of a resource. Some examples of resources are labor, tools, equipment, materials, and software. You'll want to ask yourself, how much will each of these resources cost the company? Sometimes a project can be derailed because the project manager didn't adequately include funds for reserves or buffers.

> ### Reserve analysis
>
> A method to check for remaining project resources

Performing a reserve analysis will help you account for any bugger funds you may need. A reserve analysis is a method to check for remaining project resources. In performing a reserve analysis, you'll review all potential risks to your project and determine if you need to add buffer funds. These funds are necessary because new costs that you didn't originally foresee will arise.

> ### Contingency budget
>
> Money that is included to cover potentially unforeseen events that aren't accounted for in a cost estimate

This is also known as contingency budget. Contingency budget in the context of project management, is money that is included to cover potentially unforeseen events that aren't accounted for in a cost estimate. The purpose is to compensate for the uncertainty that occurs in cost and time estimates, as well as unpredictable risk exposure.

> ### Cost of quality
>
> Costs that are incurred to prevent issues with products, processes, or tasks
>
> - Prevention costs
> - Appraisal costs
> - Internal failure costs
> - External failure costs

The cost of quality refers to all of the costs that are incurred to prevent issues with products, processes, or tasks. The cost of quality includes prevention costs, appraisal costs, internal failure costs, and external failure costs. Once you've applied these factors, **resources cost rates**, **reserve analysis**, **contingency budget**, and the cost of your quality into your budget, you can estimate what your project might cost. Remember, your budget will most likely change, starting with an initial estimate is one way to ensure that you're at least on track it's okay if your budget does change, that's why we review and reforecast.

## Project budgeting 101

A **project budget** is the estimated monetary resources needed to achieve a project's goals and objectives. In previous lessons, we covered a wide range of information related to project budgets.

Budgets are typically created in the **initiation** and **planning phases** of your project. As with any other project management document, you need to continue to review and control the budget throughout the life cycle of you r project. Your budget is more than just how much it will cost to complete the project-it is a helpful tool to reference when communicating with stakeholders and can double as a tracker for your project's progress. Budgets also help control your costs and act as the baseline for the financial portion of the project.

### **Project budgeting best practices**

Here are a few tips to consider when creating your project budget:

- **Reference historical data:** Your project may be similar to a previous project your organization has worked on. It is important to review how the project's budget was handled, find out what went well, and learn from any previous mistakes.
- **Utilize your team, mentors, or manager:** Get into the habit of asking for your team to double check your work to give you additional sets of eyes on your documents.
- **Time-phase your budget:** Time-phase budgeting allows you to allocate costs for project tasks over the projected timeline in which those expenses are planned to take place. By looking at your tasks against a timeline, you can track and compare planned versus actual costs over time and manage changes to your budget as necessary.
- **Check, check, and double check:** Make sure that your budget is accurate and error-free. Your budget will likely require approval from another department, such as finance a or senior management, so do your best to ensure that it is as straightforward to understand as possible and that ll of your calculations are correct.

### **Categorize different types of costs**

There are different types of costs that your project will incur. For example, you may need to account for both **direct costs** and **indirect costs** in your project budget. Categorize these different types of costs in your budget so that you can ensure you are meeting the requirements of your organization and customer.

#### **Direct costs**

These are costs for items that are necessary in order to complete your project. These costs can include:

- Wages and salaries of employees and contractors
- Materials costs
- Equipment rental costs
- Software licenses
- Project-related travel and transportation costs
- Staff training

#### **Indirect costs**

These are costs for items which do not directly lead to the completion of your project but are still essential for the project team to do their work. They are also referred to as **overhead costs**. These costs can include:

- Administrative costs
- Utilities
- Insurance
- General office equipment
- Security

### **Develop a baseline budget**

A **baseline budget** is an estimate of project costs that you start with at the beginning of your project. Once you have created a budget for your project and gotten it approved, you should publish this baseline and use it to compare against actual performance progress. This will give you insight into how your project budget is doing and allow you to make informed adjustments.

It is important to continually monitor your project budget and make changes if necessary. Be aware that budget updates can require the same approvals as your initial budget. Also, you should "re-baseline" your budget if you make significant changes. Re-baselining refers to when you update or modify a project's baseline as a result of any approved change to the schedule, cost, or deliverable content. For example, if you have a significant change in your project scope, your budget will likely be impacted. In this instance, you would need to re-baseline in order to adhere to a realistic budget.

### **Perform a reserve analysis**

A reserve analysis will help you account for any buffer funds you may need. First, review all potential risks to your project and determine if you need to add buffer funds, also referred to as a contingency budget. These funds are necessary because new costs that you did not expect are likely to happen throughout the project.

You may also want to account for cost of quality in your overall project budget. The cost of quality refers to all of the costs that are incurred to deliver a quality product or service, which can extend beyond material resources. This includes preventing or addressing issues with products, processes, or tasks, & internal and external failure costs. One example would be having to redesign a product or service due to defects. A defect could mean refunds to customers, time and money required to create a new product or service, and multiple other potential costs affecting the client.

### Key takeaways: Project Budgeting 101

Budgeting in the project management world is a complex process involving many different parties and documentation, but following the best practices described in the reading can help break it down. Remember to use historical data nad time-phasing, and reach out to your team for support. Make sure you are capturing all of the components of your budget, including direct and indirect costs. Finally, be sure to baseline your budget so you know where your money is being used and when.

## Creating a project budget

Project budgets helped to control costs throughout the duration of a project. They help project managers establish the main objectives of their project and keep them within a reasonable framework to ensure that the project makes financial sense for the company. What's the best way to start making a project budget? You'll find that as you get further along in the process, there are various resources and tactics that you can use to make sure you aren't overestimating or underestimating. You'll use techniques like:

- researching historical data,
- leveraging experts,
- the bottom-up approach,
- confirming accuracy,
- setting your baseline.

For starters, you can always review past projects that are similar to yours to get an idea of what your project could entail. We refer to that as referring to `Historical Data`. This way, you can find what past project managers did right and wrong. The more experienced you become as a project manager, the more historical data you will have to draw upon, and the better your estimations will be.

In a similar vein, you can leverage experts in the field. To leverage something means to use it to its maximum advantage. Leveraging experts means gathering their insights to do something more effectively. Reaching out to colleagues who worked on similar project in the past will be a great resource for you as an entry-level project manager. If you're asking someone outside of your company for advice, be sure to avoid sharing any confidential company information with them.

Another approach to take is the bottom-up approach. This means thinking about all the parts of a project from the beginning to the end, including making a list of every material, resource, contract worker, or anything that comes with an associated cost, and adding all of that together. You should also ask the vendors you are thinking of working with for quotes, so you can get a rough estimate of how much their work will cost. After you've created your budget with these resources, you'll want to double-check everything to confirm accuracy. Of course, the work doesn't stop once you've created the budget.

Next, you'll have to set the baseline. Your baseline is the dollar amount that you'll use to measure against, to find out if you're on track or not. and to measure the success of your project. Once you've set your baseline, you'll have to revisit that number and adjust it to match where the project is currently. Making adjustments in real-time is something you have to do a lot as a project manager. The size of the project and company will determine how often you should re-examine and update the budget. Creating a thorough budget is important to the success of your project.

With Project Plant Pals, we suggest `Breaking the Project Down into Tasks`. That's the bottom-up approach. From there, we `Estimate the Cost of each item`, `add those estimates together`, `add contingency and tax`, and `seek overall approval on our budget from our key stakeholders`. Since we're creating a new service, we'll need to hire designers and developers to build out the website and develop the app for our customers.

Once these tasks are laid out, you'll have to negotiate employee allocations, contractor rates, and shop around for vendors and delivery services. This will help you assign `Cost Estimates` to each task. Now that the tasks have been broken down and assigned, you'll need to account for `Material costs`. Do your team members and stakeholders need equipment? Maybe an employee with a disability requires modifications to accommodate or enhance their workplace. Maybe some remote workers need the hardware and accessories necessary to work from home. This is where you will include everything from computers to software related to the launch. Will you need storage space for miscellaneous plants or supplies? "Miscellaneous" is a term that we use to represent additional items that are not included in any of the other areas. Usually, they are minor items or items where there are only one or two of them, and that they are not a major budget line. Be sure to add these items to your expenses.

You will also need a few more line items. Start with the `fixed cost` that won't change over the course of the project. Let's say you're paying to advertise the web developer role to a job board. It may cost you about $50 to post that job description. That's an example of a fixed, one-time cost. Next you'll need a line item for things like travel expenses and meals. Finally, we want to account for `buffers` and `reserves`. You'll need to factor in unexpected costs that may come up later on. Be sure to leave yourself with some buffer room. We've chosen to account for 5% of the overall project budget as our buffer. This is a standard practice and depending upon how much detail you know about the project already, you can raise or lower your percentage for reserves. The client needs to be aware of this buffer in case spending start to become excessive.In which case, you need to problem-solve with the client and agree to adjust the scope.

You'll want to include a `planned cost` versus `actual cost` column too. This way, you can keep track of your cost every step of the way. We'll provide you with concrete budget templates in the reading associated with this section so you can fully immerse yourself in the process. Remember, every project will have an `estimated cost` and a `final cost`. Your goal is to get your estimate cost as close to the final cost as possible. You may have to recalibrate your estimations during the project. That's when the estimated cost to complete the project comes in.

The final cost of your project differs from the forecasted or estimate cost if you wren't exactly on target with your budget. Remember, while your goals is to get as close to the original estimate as possible, that won't always be the case. Each time you're placed on a new project, it will be helpful to look back on the final costs of previous projects and see how close you came to your goal.

## Helpful budget templates

Budgets can be created ina simple spreadsheet or with more complex software programs. Determining which tool is right for your and your project will require input from your organization and your customer.

### Budget spreadsheet templates

Budget templates are a useful tool for helping you estimate, track, and maintain a project budget. Below, you will find a few different budget templates that you can use for future projects. Each of these templates is formatted in a digital spreadsheet.

Understanding how to use SUM and AVERAGE formulas, tables, and filters are just a few of the spreadsheet skills that will make your job as a project manager much easier. Make sure to check the [course resources on spreadsheets](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/resources/E0vc0) for an introduction to these skills.

## Maintaining a project budget

You'll want to check in on your budget regularly, but what exactly does that mean? What are you checking for? How can you tell if you're staying within your budget or not? Monitoring the budget is crucial for a project manager to enforce accountability in terms of spending.

By monitoring your budget regularly, you'll be able to tell if the plans you set into action are actually being implemented on both a financial and operational level. A milestone is an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. Milestones are a metric for tracking progress in the project. Milestones are a great opportunity to re-review the budget to identify if anything needs to be reset or revisited throughout the project. That said, milestones can act as a checkpoint for budget management and payment. You have have agreed in your contract that you get paid at certain milestones rather than at the end of the project. Fixed contracts are usually paid for when certain milestones are reached, whereas time and materials' contracts are usually paid for monthly based on the hours worked on other fees associated with the work, like travel and meals. As you monitor your budget, you'll want to be on top of cost control. Cost control is a practice where a project manager identifies factors that might impact their budget and then creates effective actions to minimize variances.

Think of it this way: it's proactive budget management. It is much better to be proactive with your budget than to be reactive with your budget. If you are reacting instead of anticipating, then you may already have some kind of problem with the budget. In order to control costs, you should establish a sign-off plan and inform the appropriate stakeholders of any changes that occur.

You'll have to ask yourself which stakeholders or sponsor will be approving the contractor or vendor time sheets. What about invoices? You'll also need to make sure any changes within the project budget are agreed upon. For example, you shouldn't approve a new cost or item if it hasn't been agreed upon or if it is'nt within the scop, and you shouldn't be spending money if it's not pre-approved by your stakeholder or project sponsor.

It is also important to make sure there's good business case before brining it to the stakeholders. You'll also need to manage changes as they're made. This involves updating forecasts or estimates and tracking everything. You never want to be surprised by budget changes, and you don't want to have to keep asking stakeholders for more money. You can prevent that by revisiting these numbers on a regular basis. You'll also want to accept that budget misses will happen. It's your job to bring the expected cost overruns within acceptable limits. Before the project starts, collaborate with the project sponsors and key stakeholders to determine an acceptable limit, 1% or 10%? You'll decide together. Having a project go over budget may mean that the company will hae less funds for other areas within the business, so let's dig a little deeper into the effects ona company when a project goes under budget. Even though it seem like going under budget would be a project manager's dream, it actually isn't. If you go under budget, it's an indicator of less than satisfactory project management. Going under budget indicates that you may not have done a good job at initially estimating. Going under budget could also indicate that you could have spent more money on the project, meaning that you could have possibly had extra resources or better quality output, and it may mean that the budget for future projects will be slashed. The company may figure that since you did this project under budget, you'll be able to do future projects under budget too, so that's not a totally desirable situation to be in either. The best option is to adequately account for, adapt, and manage your budget with that risk in mind. Later on, we'll cover other strategies more in depth that you could use to save the company money and time.
