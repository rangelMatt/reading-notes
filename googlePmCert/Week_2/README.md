## Value of a project manager

> **Project Managers**:
> Shepherd projects from start to finish and serve as guides for their team, using their impeccable organizational and interpersonal skills every step of the way.

Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved time frame.

Values:

- Prioritization
- Delegation
- effective communication

Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective prioritization of tasks required to complete a project.

PM's are experts at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps.

When a PM is unsure of what task to prioritize, determine which ones are the most critical to the success of the projects, by connecting with their teams and with stakeholders to gather information and make a plan.

> **Stakeholders**:
> People who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success.

You can be a stakeholder of painting a house you have just rented. You need to organize a plan before painting each room. Like, lay down some rags to protect the floor, set up some blue tape to the rooms edges, etc.

Other steps like choosing faceplates for light switches can come later. In the event of running out of time or money, you can always just leave the existing plates.

Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work.

In terms of painting a house, you may have a friend that is an experienced house painter. So you can ask her to paint the ceiling and more detailed parts of the house. This is applying the strengths to the correct individuals.

Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders.

Checking in regularly with your team is an example of how to support your team. As for painting the house, checking in on your friends will let you know if you need to buy more paint before the paint runs out. It is good to note that the PM, you painting the house, also checks in with the landlord a few days in advanced to be sure that this something ok with them.
