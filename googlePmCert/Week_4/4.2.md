## Introduction to organizational culture

An organization's culture provides context and acts as a guide for what their people value, how they operate on a daily basis, how they relate to one another, and how they can be expected to perform.

Understanding an organization's culture wil help you navigate your team more effectively toward achieving the project's goal. It also impacts the way you plan your project.

If you're ever stuck in your project and need guidance about making a certain decision, or are unsure how to communicate with someone in the organization, reviewing the mission and values may help direct you toward the right way to handle that situation.

If you are interviewing for a project management position, asking about the culture is a great way to get more information about the company. It also shows the interviewer that you're knowledgeable about the impact culture can have ona project.

To get a better sense of an organization's culture, ask the following questions:

- How do people prefer to communicate?
- Is it primarily through scheduled meetings, via email, over the phone?
- How are decisions made, majority vote or top down approvals?
- What kinds of rituals are in place when someone new comes to the office? Are they taken out to lunch, given a tour of the building or introduced to the staff?
- How are projects typically run? Do they prefer a Classic, do they prefer Matrix, or some other style of project management?
- What kinds of practices, behaviors, and values are reflected by the people in the organization?

### The importance of organizational culture

- **Identity**: An organization's culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts business, both internall and externally. A company's values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost thing of an organization's culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company's (or target company's) mission and value statements.
- **People**: Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company's best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and wat to drive for success. An organization's culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees' attire, expressions, and overall behavior.
- **Processes**: Organizational culture can have direct impacts on company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization's culture is instilled throughout the company-from its employees to how its employees do their job. For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture.
