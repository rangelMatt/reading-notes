## Overview of Classic and Matrix structures

Organizational structure refers to the way a company or organization is arranged or structured. This structure also tells you how job tasks are divided and coordinated and how all the different members of the organization relate to one another.

Understanding the different types of organizational structures can serve as a map to help you determine where you fit in, who you should communicate with, and how frequently to communicate with them.

An organization's structure is most commonly mapped out using a reporting chart or "org chart", which is short of "organizational chart."

### Classic

> **Classic** <br>
> Functional or top-down structures

The classic grouping follows a typical chain of command where the Chief Executive Officer, also known as CEO, and other executives are the top, followed by directors or managers, then their direct reports and so on.

Each of these directors or managers typically oversee teams within their function of the organization, like marketing, sales, or human resources.

### Matrix

> **Matrix structure** <br>
> Direct higher-ups and stakeholders from other departments or programs

Where you may have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments who expect to hear updates on your work progress. These people may not be your direct bosses, but you are responsible for communicating with them, since they may inform changes to your work.

During an interview, you can ask about the type of organizational structure the company uses and where your roll will fit in.

## A project manager's role within different organizational structures

### Classic organizational structures

The **Classic organizational structure** is a top-down hierarchy system, where a CEO has direct authority over several department managers. The department manager has direct authority over several other sections of employees. This system requires communication both and down the ladder. In a Classic structure, authority comes from the top and filters to the bottom. Frequent reporting of project status updates may be required to pass up through management level to keep higher leaders informed.

Classic organizations are also referred to as **functional organizations** because the organization is divided into departments based on function. Each departments is led by a **functional manager**, and employees are grouped according to the functions of their role.

### Matrix organizational structures

The **Matrix** structure differs from the Classic structure in that the employees have two or more managers. In Matrix structures, you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments with whom you will need to communicate on our work progress. Functional areas tend to cross paths more frequently, and depending on the nature of the work, the responsible manager for each area has the most authority.

As a project manager in a Matrix organization, a team will essentially have at least two chains of command, or managers. You can think of the project manager as being a temporary manager while assigned to the team. The functional manager is consistent regardless of the project a project manager is supporting.

### Key takeaway: Project manager's role within different organizational structures

In both Classic and Matrix organizations, project managers must clearly define roles and responsibilities in order to work effectively. However, within most Matrix organizations, some project managers or department leads may have the same level of authority as the functional managers and operate more directly.

## How organizational structure impacts project management

An organization's structure provides the framework for accountability and communication.

As a project manager, it's vital that you understand who you're reporting to on each project, and just as importantly, who the members of your team report to. Knowing the organizational structure also tell you how and where to get the resources you'll need so you can get the project done efficiently.

Another way organizational structures can impact project management is through resource availability. Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipment, and budget that we need.

In a Classic structure, you might find yourself with less authority and a tighter scope. You may need to rely on getting approval from the appropriate managers, directors, and department heads in order to move forward and complete certain tasks.

Matrix structure, the main difference with a Matrix structure is that employees often have two or more managers or leaders they'll need to work with and update. The team members wil have their functional manager and you, the project manager. If members are working on multiple projects, they may have even more managers. This can affect your authority as a project manager, as you will need to cooperate with more than one leader in the organization. You may need to share resources and negotiate priorities. Because there isn't always a clear chain of command in a Matrix structure, you need to make sure you have identified and communicated with anyone you might need to report to and get approval from well before the project begins. As the project manager, you will generally have more autonomy to make decisions and gather resources as needed.

## The role of a Project Management Office

### What is PMO(Project Management Office)

A Project Management Office, or PMO, is a group within an organization that defines, sets, and helps maintain project management standards and processes throughout that organization. It often acts as a coordinated center for all of the organization's projects, helping them run more smoothly and efficiently.

### What are the functions of a PMO?

PMO's offer guidance and support to their organization's project managers. They share best practices, project statuses, and direction for all of the organization's projects while often taking on strategic projects themselves. The main function of a PMO include:

#### **Strategic planning and governance**

This is this most import function of a PMO. This involves defining project criteria, selecting projects according to the organization's business goals, and the providing a business case for those projects to management.

#### **Best practices**

PMOs help implement best practices and processes within their organization. They also share lessons learned form previous successful projects. They help ensure consistency among their organization's projects by providing guidance about processes, tools, and metrics.

#### **Common project culture**

PMOs help set common project culture practices by training employees about optimal approaches and best practices. This helps keep project management practices consistent and efficient across the entire organization.

#### **Resource management**

PMOs are often responsible for managing and allocating resources-such as people and equipment-across projects throughout the organization based on budget, priorities, schedules, and more. They also help define the roles and responsibilities needed pon any given project. PMOs provide training, mentoring, and coaching to all employees, but project managers in particular.

#### **Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools**

PMOs invest in and provide templates, tools, and software to help manage projects. They also play an important role in maintaining their organization's project history. Once a project closes, they archive all of the documents created during the project for future reference and to capture lessons learned.

### Key takeaway: Role of a Project Management Office

Key purposes of a PMO include:

- Strategic planning and governance
- Implementing Project management best practices
- Establishing common project culture
- resource management
- creating project documentation, archives, and tools
