> The process of delivering your completed project and getting people to adopt it

Understanding change management can ensure that a project is completed successfully and that the organization accepts and adopts the recommendations from the project.

Adoption is often the first step to your project having the desired impact once it goes live.

It's important to recognize that it's the people in an organization who are directly impacted by any changes in the workplace. Implementing a new project can mean changes to processes, budgets, schedules, and employee roles and responsibilities.

Change management in project management is centered around three core concepts and best practices.

### Core concepts

- Create a sense of ownership and urgency

> **Ownership** means getting others to feel they are empowered to take responsibility for the successful completion of their tasks.
>
> **Urgency** means getting them to understand that the project is important and to identify what actions need to be taken to move the project along.

When team members feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases interest, motivation, and engagement with the project outcome.

- Figure out the right combination of skills and personalities

One effective way of motivating your team is to communicate clearly your vision and approach for the project. Then you can share how you see everyone working together as a team to make it happen.

- Effective communication

Having effective communication with your team means being transparent and up front with your plans and ideas and making information available. Make sure your team, along with the rest of the organization, is kept up-to-date on your progress.

Agile project management aligns itself with change management because it's being receptive to change is a core value.

## A project manager's role in change management

### Integrating project management and change management

When it comes to change management, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end process. There will be times when your manager, a team member, or another senior leader might be responsible for taking on that transition and successfully implementing the changes. However, just because you're note the one directly leading the change, there are still ways in which you can support and participate in the successful adoption of your project.

The most effective way to achieve a project goal is to integrate project management and change management, and it is your responsibility as a project manager to do so.

When you are thinking about change management as it relates to your project, begin by asking yourself the following questions:

- How will the organization react to change?
- Which influencers can affect change?
- What are the best means of communication
- What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project?

Best practices for approaching change management on your projects:

**Be proactive.** Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.

- Incorporate change management into your project management steps. For example, you can schedule time during team meetings or create a feedback document to ensure that your team members know there is a place to voice their suggestions and concerns.
- You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to stakeholders in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos. you can factor all of these decisions into your plan so that nay potential changes are less likely to impact your timeline. If these steps have not been built into your plan, you can escalate and stress the importance of a change management plan to your stakeholders.

**Communicate about upcoming changes.** Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team. Check in and communicate throughout the project about how the changes will provide a better experience for end users of the project deliverables. In this way, you support the process by providing everyone with the information they need to feel prepared to adjust to changes once the project is ready to launch.

**Follow a consistent process.** Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change. The change management process should be established and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change. your organization may also have an overarching change management plan that can be adopted for your project. This may include when the promotion of the change should happen, when training should occur, when the launch or release will occur, and corresponding steps for each phase of the process.

**Practice empathy.** Changes are inevitable, but we are often resistant to them. By being empathetic to the challenges and anxiety change can bring, you can support the process in subtle ways.

**Use tools.** Incorporating tools to assist in the adoption of a change can be very helpful. Here are some examples:

- **Feedback mechanisms**, such as surveys, can capture input form stakeholders,
- [Flowcharts](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-a-flowchart-tutorial) can visualize the project's development process.
- [Culture mapping](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2015/10/13/the-culture-map-a-systematic-intentional-tool-for-designing-great-company-culture)can illustrate the company's culture and how the company's values, norms, and employees behavior may be affected by the change.

## Participating in change management

Change management is actually a huge undertaking and a project in itself. A project manager may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end change management process. Instead, the project manager may ask a member of the project team, their manager, or another senior leader to help take on that transition. If the project manager is participating in change management, then someone else is responsible for successfully implementing the changes. But just because the project manager is not the one directly calling for, or leading the change, there's still ways in which the project manager can participate.

Being empathetic to the challenges of change management can help the project manager support the process in subtle ways. The project manager can support the process by providing employees with information so they feel prepared to adjust to changes once the system is ready to launch.

> ### An example of change management in a Classic organizational structure that has an informal corporate structure
>
> A final project requires a name change from the old check-in system called "Speedy Care" to the new system called "Speedy Check-in". Getting this change implemented, is an example of change management. As the project manager, you need to participate in the change management process by communicating the project needs through the appropriate channels. In this case, the chief executive officer, sends an email to the C-suite. The CEO lets them know that the name must be changed and to please inform their teams to implement the name change. Because this is a Classic structure within a hierarchical organization, the budgets are managed separately, and the marketing department needs to request an extra $10,000 to change all of their printed posters for the stores. This request goes back up to the Chief Financial Officer. The project manager may need to have multiple meetings with others to help them understand what is changing, and why.

> ### An example of change management in a Matrix organizational structure that has a formal corporate culture
>
> Same scenario as the Classic organization, but handled differently. The project manager might meet with representatives from marketing and technology to explain the overall budget impact for all the necessary changes. With formal culture, the project manager might write a document that describes all budget, timeline, and training impacted by the name change. Then the PM might circulate that document to get feedback and alignment from all the stakeholders and share that feedback with the CEO so they can understand the full scope of the name change. The feedback and alignment from the stakeholders will tell the CEO how the change management process went. Did everyone agree on the implications? Was the feedback positive, or was there resistance? Then, when the CEO needs to communicate the name change to the entire organization, they may have someone on her team write up a formal memo that describes why the name change needs to happen and share out the memo to her staff and their teams.

A few questions to ask yourself that will inform change management:

- How will the organization react to chang?
- Which influencers can affect change?
- What are the best means of communication?
- What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project?

## Corporate and project governance

**Governance** in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined. The governance is understanding who is in charge.

### Corporate governance

Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called **corporate governance**, and they will influence your projects. Corporate governance is the framework by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives. Corporate governance is also a way to balance the requirements of the various corporate entities, such as stakeholders, management, and customers. Corporate governance affects every part of an organization, including action plans, internal and external controls, and performance measurements.

Governance and change management go hand-in-hand. To successfully implement change management, it is essential that you understand the culture of the organization. Effective governance in change management provides clearly defined roles and responsibilities during change. This enables the people within the organization to have a precise understanding of who makes decisions and of the relationship between those managing and participating in the change management process.

Another example of governance within an organization is the creation and use of **steering committees**. Steering committees decide on the priorities of an organization and mange the general course of its operations. The steering committee essentially acts as an advisory board or council to help the project manager and the company make and approve strategic decisions that affect both the company and the project.

### Project governance

As a project manager, you will be responsible for **project governance**. Project governance is the framework for how project decisions are made. Project governance helps keep projects running smoothly, on time, and within budget. Project governance involves all the key elements that make a project successful. It tells you what activities an organization does and who is responsible for those activities. Project governance covers policies, regulations, functions, process, procedures, and responsibilities.

### How project and corporate governance intersect

Project governance needs to be tailored to your organization's specific needs. These needs will influence how you implement and monitor the governance framework on your project. Project governance concerns those areas of corporate governance that are specifically related to project activities. Effective project governance ensures that an organization's projects are aligned to the organization's larger objectives, are delivered efficiently, and are sustainable.
This includes:

- **Considering** the long- and short-term interests of your organization
- Making _thoughtful_ decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if you do not have sufficient resources.
- **Providing** **timely, relevant, and reliable information** to the board of directors and other major stakeholders.
- **Eliciting** the **input** and buy-in of senior managers since they are the decisions-makers
- During the **initiation** **phase**, prioritizing clear, reachable, and sustainable goals in order to reduce confusion and conflict
- During the **planning** **phase**, assigning ownership and accountability to an experienced team to deliver, monitor, and control the process
- During the **execution** **phase**, learning from mistakes and adapting to new or improved knowledge.

Corporate governance can involve clearing many hurdles before making decisions. These decisions can influence no only a single project, but the entire corporation.

## Key takeaway: Corporate and project governance

When interviewing for a new role, and begin a new project, consider an organization's governance process and practices in the same way. This will help you understand how decisions are made, who is responsible for what, and what are the potential issues and areas of concern.
