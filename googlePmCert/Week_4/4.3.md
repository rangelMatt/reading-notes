> The process of delivering your completed project and getting people to adopt it

Understanding change management can ensure that a project is completed successfully and that the organization accepts and adopts the recommendations from the project.

Adoption is often the first step to your project having the desired impact once it goes live.

It's important to recognize that it's the people in an organization who are directly impacted by any changes in the workplace. Implementing a new project can mean changes to processes, budgets, schedules, and employee roles and responsibilities.

Change management in project management is centered around three core concepts and best practices.

### Core concepts

- Create a sense of ownership and urgency

> **Ownership** means getting others to feel they are empowered to take responsibility for the successful completion of their tasks.
>
> **Urgency** means getting them to understand that the project is important and to identify what actions need to be taken to move the project along.

When team members feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases interest, motivation, and engagement with the project outcome.

- Figure out the right combination of skills and personalities

One effective way of motivating your team is to communicate clearly your vision and approach for the project. Then you can share how you see everyone working together as a team to make it happen.

- Effective communication

Having effective communication with your team means being transparent and up front with your plans and ideas and making information available. Make sure your team, along with the rest of the organization, is kept up-to-date on your progress.

Agile project management aligns itself with change management because it's being receptive to change is a core value.

### Integrating project management and change management

When it comes to change management, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end process. There will be times when your manager, a team member, or another senior leader might be responsible for taking on that transition and successfully implementing the changes. However, just because you're note the one directly leading the change, there are still ways in which you can support and participate in the successful adoption of your project.

The most effective way to achieve a project goal is to integrate project management and change management, and it is your responsibility as a project manager to do so.

When you are thinking about change management as it relates to your project, begin by asking yourself the following questions:

- How will the organization react to change?
- Which influencers can affect change?
- What are the best means of communication
- What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project?

Best practices for approaching change management on your projects:

**Be proactive.** Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.

- Incorporate change management into your project management steps. For example, you can schedule time during team meetings or create a feedback document to ensure that your team members know there is a place to voice their suggestions and concerns.
- You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to stakeholders in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos. you can factor all of these decisions into your plan so that nay potential changes are less likely to impact your timeline. If these steps have not been built into your plan, you can escalate and stress the importance of a change management plan to your stakeholders.

**Communicate about upcoming changes.** Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team. Check in and communicate throughout the project about how the changes will provide a better experience for end users of the project deliverables. In this way, you support the process by providing everyone with the information they need to feel prepared to adjust to changes once the project is ready to launch.

**Follow a consistent process.** Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change. The change management process should be established and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change. your organization may also have an overarching change management plan that can be adopted for your project. This may include when the promotion of the change should happen, when training should occur, when the launch or release will occur, and corresponding steps for each phase of the process.

**Practice empathy.** Changes are inevitable, but we are often resistant to them. By being empathetic to the challenges and anxiety change can bring, you can support the process in subtle ways.

**Use tools.** Incorporating tools to assist in the adoption of a change can be very helpful. Here are some examples:

- **Feedback mechanisms**, such as surveys, can capture input form stakeholders,
