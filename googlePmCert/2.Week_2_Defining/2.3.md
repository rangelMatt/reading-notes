## Measurable

Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because the leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders.

## Defining a SMART goal

Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can **measure** the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate-a tangible outcome.

In this example, your **specific** goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal **attainable** by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is **relevant** because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal **time-bound** by deciding that you will complete the program within 6 months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next 6 months.

## Key takeaway: SMART Goals

Determining metrics can be extremely helpful in capturing statuses, successes, delays, and more in a project. As a project manager, identifying meaningful metrics can help move the project toward its goal. Additionally, by defining each element of a project goal to make it SMART, you can determine what success means for that goal and how to achieve it.
