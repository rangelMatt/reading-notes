# Assigning project team roles and responsibilities

## Elements of a RACI Chart

Moving on to a handy tool called a RACI chart.

> A RACI chart helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently

A RACI chart creates clear roles and gives direction for each team member. There are four types of participation included in a RACI chart.

- **R**esponsible
  - Those doing the work to complete the task
- **A**ccountable
  - Those making sure the work gets done
- **C**onsulted
  - Those giving feedback, like a subject matter experts or decision makers
- **I**nformed
  - Those just needing to know the final decisions, or that a task is complete

When creating your RACI chart, you need to:

1. Write down each task or deliverable for your project
2. Assign it the appropriate role for each stakeholder. To do this,
3. First think about who's involved in the project. Write the roles or people's names ina a row across the top of your chart.

> **Pro-tip:** Use roles rather than names if some people might take on more than one role.

4. Write done the tasks or deliverables in column on the left. (Not to specific, chart to be simple and easy to read)
5. Go through each task and deliverable and ask:
   - Who's responsible for doing this?
   - Who's accountable if it doesn't get done?
   - Who will have strong opinions to add, and therefore, should be consulted about how this gets done?
   - Who needs to be informed of the progress or decisions made about this?
6. Assign the letters `R,A,C, and I` based on our answers.

It's possible there are several roles that fall into the "informed" and "consulted" categories. One thing that will always remain constant is there will never be more than one persone designated as "accountable." This prevents confusion, because having one person accountable clearly defines ownership. However, the same person that is "accountable" may also be "responsible." There are several other factors that can cause role confusion. For example, there might tbe unbalanced workloads, which means some people might be doing more work or less work than others on the team. Or there could be an unclear hierarchy when people aren't sure who to seek help from if a task doesn't get done or unclear ownership of decisions where people aren't sure who makes the final call on a project.

Another issue could be overlapping work. This is when teams or individuals feel that they're responsible for the same work. When this happens, things can get confusing fast, And the same goes for excessive communication. While communication is usually a good thing, too much communication can actually make things more complicated. It can cause information overload where people don't know what to pay attention to, and so they miss something important.

## Building out a RACI chart

A **RACI chart** can be an extremely effective way to define project roles, give direction to each team member and stakeholder, and ensure work gets done efficiently. Having a RACI chart available throughout the duration of your project as a quick visual can be invaluable. In this reading, we will cover the function of a RACI chart and its components and explore how project managers use RACI charts to define and document project roles and responsibilities.

### Elements of a RACI chart

A RACI chart creates clear roles and gives direction to each team member and stakeholder. Over your career, you may hear a RACI chart referred to as a Responsibility Assignment Matrix(RAM), RACI diagram, or RACI matrix. The ultimate goal of this chart is to clarify each person's role on your project.

First, let's break down each of the roles people can be assigned:

**R**: Responsible: Who gets the work done.
**A**: Accountable: Who makes sure the work is done.
**C**: Consulted: Who gives input or feedback on work
**I**: Informed: Who needs to know the outcome.

Note that RACI charts can be organized in different ways, depending on personal preference, number of tasks being assigned, and number of people involved. In the previous video we showed you one RACI chart format. The template below shows another way a typical RACI chart might be organized.

Let's further examine each of the roles and how to determine which team member should be assigned to which role.

## Responsible

Individuals who are assigned the "responsible" role for a task are the ones who are actually doing the work to complete the task. Every task needs to at least one responsible party. It's a best practice to try to limit the number of team members assigned to a task's responsible role, but in some cases, you may have more than one.

A couple of questions to ask yourself when determining which person or people should be placed in the responsible role for a given task are:

- What department does the work fall under?
- Who will perform the work?

It is helpful to evaluate the people on your team to determine the role that suits them. Remember that you may need to list roles rather than names, if some people take on more than one role.

Let's dig deeper into our example with Office Green. Our task is to develop price points for the project, and the Financial Analyst will complete the work for this task. Therefore, we will list "Financial Analyst" in the responsible role for this task in the RACI chart.

## Accountable

The "accountable" person is responsible for making sure the task gets done. It is important to have only one individual accountable for each task. This helps clarify ownership of the task. The Accountable person ultimately has the authority to approve the deliverable of the responsible party.

In order to determine who should be tagged as the accountable team member, consider:

- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
- Who will review the work to determine if the task is complete?

You may encounter a situation where the responsible party is also accountable, but where possible, it is helpful to separate these roles. Ensuring that accountability is not shared ensures that there is no confusion on who the ownership belongs to.

Continuing with our Office Green example, you have assigned the "accountable" role to the Head of FInance. The Head of Finance has to make sure the project stays in budget and makes a profit, so they have the ultimate authority over the price points for the product. Therefore, they will need to approve the Financial Analyst's work on the task.

![Accountable Example](/Images/accountable-%20example.jpeg)

## Consulted

Team members or stakeholders who are placed in the "consulted" role have useful information to help complete the task. There is no maximum or minimum number of people who can be assigned a "consulted" role, but it's important that each person has a reason for being there.

Here are a few ways you can help identify who is appropriate for the role:

- Who will the task impact?
- Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
- Who are the subject matter experts (SMEs) for the task?

The consulted people will be in frequent, two-way communication with the responsible party, so it is key to make sure that the right people are in this role to help accomplish the task efficiently and correctly.

Back to the project at Office Green, we've got a "responsible" Financial ANalyst and an "accountable" Head of Finance. Who else would need to provide input on the product's price points? Whose decisions and feedback will directly affect the task? The Director of Product will need to be consulted on the matter, as they oversee all product offerings. This perosn will have information about potential changes to the product and how these changes might affect price points.

![Consulted Example](/Images/consulted%20example.jpeg)

## Informed

Individuals who are identified as needing to be "informed" need to know the final decisions that were made and when a task is completed. It is common to have many people assigned to this category and for some team members to be informed on most tasks. Team members or stakeholders here will not asked for feedback, so it is key to make sure people who are in the group only require status updates and do not need to provide any direct feedback for the completion of the effort.

Key questions to ask yourself in order to ensure that you have appropriately captured individuals in hte "informed" role are:

- Who cares about this tasks's completion?
- Who will be affected by the outcome?

NOw that you've determined who is responsible, accountable, and consulted on the Office Green project task, it is time to determine who needs to be informed about hte task. Your Financial Analyst has set the price points with input form the Director of Product, and the Head of Finance has approved. You will now need to inform the Sales Team about the final price points, as they will ned this information to sell the product.

![Informed Example](/Images/informed%20example.jpeg)

**Pro tip:** You could end up with a large number of team members and stakeholders who are placed in the "informed" role. If so, make sure that you have a plan to keep them informed that is not labor-intensive. Something as easy as view-only access to your project plan or meeting notes could prevent you form having to create separate communications along the way.

## Key takeaway: Building out a RACI chart

The RACI chart is a valuable tool. It can help you define an document project roles and responsibilities, give you direction to each team member and stakeholder, and ensure work gets done efficiently. A RACI chart can also help you analyze and balance the workload of your team. While it may take many revisions to make sure that your team members and stakeholders are being placed into the right roles in your RACI chart, doing this work up front helps save time and prevent miscommunications later on.

## Getting the most out of a RACI chart

In the previous video, you learned how critical a **RACI chart** is for creating roles and giving direction to each team member on a project. In this reading, we will further explore the function and components of RACI charts and how to use them to communicate responsibilities to project teams.

### Definition and structure

Determining who is **R**esponsible, **A**ccountable, **C**onsulted and **I**nformed on your projects allows you to keep control of the stakeholders roles on your project.

![RACI Structure](/Images/raci-structure.png)

### Workload balance

Are there too many tasks assigned to one stakeholder? When you complete your chart, it is a good idea to go back through and tally the number of Rs assigned to each stakeholder. This can help you identify potentially overloading one team member with work. Using a RACI chart to determine responsibility for tasks can help mitigate single points of failure (known as creating **silos**, where the knowledge and responsibility for a task falls on one person) and allow you, as the project manager, to delegate tasks and avoid burnout. Maintaining workload balance is a critical part of project management. It is easy to fall into the patter of relying on your top performers to keep the project moving forward. But this isn't always healthy for the project or your tea. If you find that you don't have the right people to assign responsibilities to, take a step back and evaluate you team.

### Put your RACI into practice

Once you have created your RACI chart, it is time to put it into practice. You will first need to share your RACI chart with your sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and sign-off. When you get stakeholder buy-in, you will be able to set clear expectations for your team and ensure that everyone is aligned on their responsibilities.

You can document your team and stakeholders' acknowledgement of these expectations through the project charter, meeting notes, and in the RACI chart itself. Think back to a time when you were expected to do something you did not agree with, or weren't clear on. That disagreement or lack of clarity made it difficult to do your best work, right? Getting buy-in and continually checking in with your stakeholders and your team is the way to avoid this potential pitfall!

As you take the time to ensure that each task has an owner identified with the appropriate level of engagement, you are streamlining your communication and decision-making process over the life cycle of your project.

### When should you use a RACI chart?

If you are wondering if you should use a RACI chart on your project, it is a good idea to evaluate the complexity of the effort. For example, if you have a very small project team with a small number of stakeholders, clearly defined roles, and a short timeline, introducing a RACI chart could possibly slow down the project. However, larger project, or even projects that involve a large number of stakeholder, could greatly benefit from a RACI chart. It is always a good idea to work through the creation of a RACI chart and evaluate the outcome. Even if you do not end up using the RACI chart, you will have a better understanding of the project, and your effort will contribute to your project management experience overall.
