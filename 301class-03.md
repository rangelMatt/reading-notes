# Code 301 Class 03 Reading Notes

## [React Docs - lists and keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

1. **What does .map() return?** creates a new array populated with elements from the provided function on every element in the calling array.
2. **If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?** By transforming arrays into lists of elements, using `.map()` to loop through an array.
3. **Each list item needs a unique** string.
4. **What is the purpose of a key?** Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

## [The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

1. **What is the spread operator?** The spread operator is an ellipsis of three dots `(...)` to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.
2. **List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**

 > * Copying an Array
 > * Concatenating or combining arrays
 > * Using Math functions
 > * Using an array as arguments

3. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.** `let merged = [...arr1, ...arr2];`
4. **Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.** `let addMore = [1, 2, ...manyMore];`
5. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.** `let totalObject = {...recallObj, ...recollectionObj};`

## [How to Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)

1. **First step that the developer does to pass functions between components?** Create a function where you will call and pass in a object.
2. **What does the `increment` function do?** Looping through the people array, and checking if there is a match in the name, if there is a match, the count will increase by one.
3. **How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**  Pass it with a prop, by creating something into the child component
4. **How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?** Call the parent method using props

## Things I want to know more about

* How to Pass Functions between Components. Video was good, I think I just need more exposure to help with the specifics.
