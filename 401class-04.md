## [Read & Write Files in Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)

### What Is a File?

A file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. The data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. All these byte files are just binary 1's and 0's for easier processing by the computer.

Three main parts for the modern file system.

1. **Header**: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type)
2. **Data**: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
3. **End of File (EOF)**: special character that indicates the end of the file.

### File Paths

The file path is a string that represents the location of a file.

1. **Folder Path**: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or a backslash \ (Windows)
2. **File Name**: the actual name of the file
3. **Extension**: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period(.)used to indicate the file type.

```json
/
│
├── path/  ← Referencing this parent folder
|   │
|   ├── to/  ← Current working directory (cwd)
|   │   └── cats.gif
|   │
|   └── dog_breeds.txt  ← Accessing this file
|
└── animals.csv
```

The double (..) can be chained together to traverse multiple directories above the current directory. For example, to access animals.csv from the to folder, you would uses `../../animals.csv`.

### Line Endings

The line ending has its roots from back in the Morse Code era, when a specific pro-sign was used to communicate the end of a transmission or the end of a line.

This was carried over by the International Organization for Standardization(ISO) and the American Standards Association(ASA).

Windows view new lines like the below:

```json
Pug\r\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r\n
English Springer Spaniel\r\n
German Shepherd\r\n
```

While Unix will view it as the below:

```json
Pug\r
\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r
\n
English Springer Spaniel\r
\n
German Shepherd\r
\n
```

This can make iterating over each line problematic, and we may need to account for situations like this.

### Character Encodings

The two most common encodings are the ASCII and UNICODE formats. ASCII can only store 128 characters, while Unicode can contain up to  1,114,112 characters.

### Opening and Closing a File in Python

Invoke the `open()` built-in function when you want to open a file when you want to work on it.

Remember to close the file after you are doing using it. Most cases, the file will close on it's own, but this may cause unusual behavior.

See below for an example to open and close a file.

```json
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
try:
  # Further file processing goes here
finally:
  reader.close()
```

The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block, even in cases of error. 

```json
with open('dogs_breeds.txt','r') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```

The 'r' is a default, read-ony mode as a text file.

### Text File Types

```json
open('abc.txt')
open('abc.txt','r')
open('abc.txt','w')
```

### Buffered Binary File Types

A buffered binary file type is used for reading and writing binary files. Here are some examples of how these files are opened:

```json
open('abc.txt','rb')
open('abc.txt','wb')
```

### Raw File Types

A raw file type is:

> "generally used as a low-level building-block for binary and text streams" [python library](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/io.html#raw-i-o)

These are not typically used.

### Reading and Writing Opened Files

- .read(size=-1) This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 passed. then the entire file is read.
- .readline(size=-1) This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.
- .readlines() This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.

```json
with open('dog_breads.txt','r') as reader:
  print(reader.read())
Pug
Jack Russell Terrier
English Springer Spaniel
German Shepherd
Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Golden Retriever
West Highland White Terrier
Boxer
Border Terrier

with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
  print(reader.readline(5))
  print(reader.readline(5))
  print(reader.readline(5))
  print(reader.readline(5))
  print(reader.readline(5))

Pug

Jack
Russe
ll Te
rrier
```

Iterating Over Each Line in the File

```json
with open('dog_breeds.txt','r') as reader:
  line = reader.readline()
  while line != '':
    print(line, end='')
    line = reader.readline()

with open('dog_breeds.txt','r') as reader:
  for line in reader.readlines():
    print(line,end='')

with open('dog_breeds.txt','r') as reader:
  for line in reader:
    print(line, end='')

// All above will render the below list, separately

Pug
Jack Russell Terrier
English Springer Spaniel
German Shepherd
Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Golden Retriever
West Highland White Terrier
Boxer
Border Terrier   
```

### Working With Bytes

|Value |Interpretation |
--- | --- |
|0x89|A "magic" number to indicate that this is the start of a PNG|
|0x50 0x4E 0x47|PNG in ASCII|
|0x0D 0x0A|A DOS style line ending \r\n|
|0x1A|A DOS style EOF character|
|0x0A|A Unix style line ending \n|

### Appending to a File

You can append to a file or start writing at the end of a populated file bu adding the 'a' character for the mode argument:

```json
with open('dog_breeds.txt','a') as a_writer:
  a_writer.write('\nBeagle')

with open('dog_breeds.txt','r') as reader:
  print(reader.read())
Pug
Jack Russell Terrier
English Springer Spaniel
German Shepherd
Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Golden Retriever
West Highland White Terrier
Boxer
Border Terrier
Beagle
```
