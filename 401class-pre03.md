# Code 401 Prep: Introduction to SQL Reading Notes

## [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)

### Overall Summary

There were a lot of takeaways from this but the hot item that immediately jumps out is if you are to delete or drop a table, double check that you are in fact deleting or dropping what you are intending to drop. There is no save or back up in SQL, it's gone... for good.

Finding and narrowing down large lists using the `SELECT` was a great starting point. You can then truly see the potential once you start using queries with constraints. WOW! finding a string sequence by just throwing in a couple of `%%` around the characters that you are searching for, or *not* searching for, will come in handy.

The sum of the takeaway from this exercise is that, it's not that much different from math methods that are being used in other languages such as greater than or lesser than, as well as equal. What else can we use here? Time to go on an play!
