# Code 301 Class 09 Reading Notes

## [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)

1. **What is a `call`** A function invocation by used by the call stack. Since the call stack is single function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.
2. **How many `calls` can happen at once?** One call can occur at once.
3. **What does LIFO mean?** **L**ast **I**n, **F**irst **O**ut
4. **Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.** ![call stack](./Images/callStackimg.png)
5. **What causes a Stack Overflow** It occurs when there is a recursive function (function that calls itself) without an exit point.

## [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

1. **What is a 'reference' error?** When you try to use a variable that is not yet declared.
2. **what is a 'syntax error'?** When you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of `syntax`.
3. **What is a 'range error'?** When manipulating an object with some kind of length and git it an invalid length.
4. **What is a 'type error'?** When the types (number, string, etc) we are tyring to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an *undefined* type of varable.
5. **what is a 'breakpoint'?** Can be achieved by putting a *debugger* statement in your code in the line you want to break.
6. **What does the word 'debugger' do in your code?** Adding the statment when running the code above you can see the 'history' before reaching that breakpoint.

## Things I want to know more about

I like the small add to help 'debbug', by adding the word `debugger;` could help with helping find reference points that is causing the break.
