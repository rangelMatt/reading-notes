## Forms

> Definition, Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that conains spaces for you to fill in information.

### How forms work

1) A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.

2) The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.

3) The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.

4) The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.

> A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.
