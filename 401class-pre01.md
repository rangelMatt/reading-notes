## [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

`...Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety...` - Carl Newport

Improving the hard technical skills makes the software we build better. It exposes us to more opportunities which will allow us to do more things with computers.

Push yourself beyond your comfort zone, repeatedly. Seek out feedback and make sure that what you are doing is difficult and requires good goals.

Once you get to a point in your career of writing out code and dealing with the same issues, you need to start implementing a deliberate practice.

The goals should be picked that when achieving them teaches you something new.

A great example to use is [The Matasano Crypto Challenges](https://web.archive.org/web/20160620111206/http://cryptopals.com/). These are incredibly difficult for intermediate to senior level developers.

Start setting yourself a small, finishable challenge that teaches you something further outside your comfort zone.

### Power of Yet

The understanding that you are in a learning curve. Understand that your abilities can be developed.

Falling into the tyranny of now, one would cheat, look for people who did worse.

1. Praise wisely
   - Praise the process

Give greater confidence by using `Not Yet`.

Transform the Meaning of Effort and Difficulty. Put more effort into schoolwork, family, and coworkers, one will see improvement in all aspects.

## [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

### Grit: The power of passion and perseverance

Iq is not the only difference between the best and worst people. Some of the smartest people, don't really do so well. Everyone can learn anything, if you are motivated enough.

One characteristic reflected a significant predictor to success. That's grit. Grit is passion and perseverance, for very long term goals. Grit is something that you stick with, not for days or weeks, but months and years.

The most shocking thing grit is, is what we don't know about it, and how to implement it. There are many talented people, who do not follow through.

The best way to build grit, is the growth mindset. The ability to learn, is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. Our brain grows, when it comes up against an obstacle. When we have to think. That's when our brain becomes stronger. This is something I want to instill in my kids, but it's so hard to get them to understand. So I have to be grittier in teaching them.

Take the best ideas, strongest intuition, and test them. Be willing to fail.
