## [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

`...Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety...` - Carl Newport

Improving the hard technical skills makes the software we build better. It exposes us to more opportunities which will allow us to do more things with computers.

Push yourself beyond your comfort zone, repeatedly. Seek out feedback and make sure that what you are doing is difficult and requires good goals.

Once you get to a point in your career of writing out code and dealing with the same issues, you need to start implementing a deliberate practice.

The goals should be picked that when achieving them teaches you something new.

A great example to use is [The Matasano Crypto Challenges](https://web.archive.org/web/20160620111206/http://cryptopals.com/). These are incredibly difficult for intermediate to senior level developers.

Start setting yourself a small, finishable challenge that teaches you something further outside your comfort zone.

### Power of Yet

The understanding that you are in a learning curve. Understand that your abilities can be developed.

Falling into the tyranny of now, one would cheat, look for people who did worse.

1. Praise wisely
   - Praise the process

Give greater confidence by using `Not Yet`.

Transform the Meaning of Effort and Difficulty. Put more effort into schoolwork, family, and coworkers, one will see improvement in all aspects.
