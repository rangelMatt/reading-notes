# Growth Mindset

## Self Proclaimed Lifelong Learner 

I am Matt, and I love to learn. But it doesn't mean that I don't get *frustrated* and want to quit sometimes. I live in a constant battle of wanting to learn something quickly and knowing it immediately to ~~throwing the computer against the wall~~ being okay with struggling to learn a new concept. 

### This is how I will keep myself in a growth mindset

* Talk through the steps of an obstacle, out loud. Write down clues as they materialize. 
* Recognizing that I am getting stuck or hitting a roadblock, then stand up, put down the project that is sucking the rhythm out, walk away, and return when I'm feeling more inspired.
* This should lead to more successes of getting back at it to do one more thing, then another, and before I realize it, I've got my groove back.

### Summary 

Consciously stopping and thinking about the growth mindset when effort is being required/asked of. No pain, no gain is true. I do a physical work out every day to remind my mind of this saying. I have to push through mentally to either get out of bed, do an extra rep, or an extra lap. This is to remind my brain, outside of working out, that I can put in the extra effort at work, with the family, and with friends as well.
