# Code 301 Class 07 Reading Notes

## [How I explained REST to my Brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?** A computer scientest, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style, also known as REST.
2. **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?** I think because without REST it would take a long time to do this. Even with REST, it will take an unordinate amount of time and code to impliment this.
3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?** REST
4. **What does a GET do?** it `GET`s stuff, using the HTTP protocol onto data in specified urls untill all the resources are obtained and the web pages are obtained.
5. **What does a POST do?** If a system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of `POST`
6. **What does PUT do?** If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of `PUT`
7. **What does PATCH do?** If it is a partial update, the system will use will use `PATCH`

## Things I want to know more about

From what I learned last week, it was difficult for me to stack that to todays lessons. Not sure where I missed the mark, but probably would be good to do a bit of review.
