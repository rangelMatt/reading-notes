## [Django Settings Best Practices](https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/)

### Managing Django Setting: Issues

**Different environments**: Usually you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. Each envirionment can have its won specific settings (for example: `DEBUG = True`, which will require more verbose logging, additional apps, mocked data, etc.) You need an approach that allows you to keep all these Django setting configurations.

**Django setting are a Python code.**: These are often in settings.py, it gives flexibility, but also can be a curse and a blessing at the same time.

### Setting Configuration: Different Approaches

**settings_local.py**: Basic idea of this method is to extend all environment specific settings in the `settings_local.py` file, which is ignored by VCS.

#### Pros

- Secrets not in VCS

#### Cons

- `settings_local.py` is not in VCS, so you can lose some of your Django environment settings.
- The Django settings file is a Python code, so `settings_local.py` can have some non obvious logic.
- You need to have `settings_local.example(in VCS)to share the default configurations for developers.

### Separate settings files for each environment

This an extension of the previous approach.
Package the settings with the following structure:

```json
settings/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── base.py
   ├── ci.py
   ├── local.py
   ├── staging.py
   ├── production.py
   └── qa.py
```

#### Pros

- All environments are in VCS.
- It’s easy to share settings between developers.

#### Cons

- You need to find a way to handle secret passwords and tokens.
- “Inheritance” of settings can be hard to trace and maintain.

### Environment variables

#### Pros

- These usually are a good method to keep configuration is separated from code.
- Environment parity – you have the same code for all environments.
- No inheritance in settings, and cleaner and more consistent code.
- There is a theoretical grounding for using environment variables – 12 Factors.

#### Cons

- You need to handle sharing default config between developers.

### Best practices

- Keep settings in environment variables.
- Write default values for productions configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens).
- Don't hardcode sensitive settings, and don't put them in VCS.
- Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project.
- Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings.

## [What is SSH: Understanding Encryption, Ports and Connection](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work)

> **SSH(Secure Shell Protocol)**: A remote administration protocol that allows users to access, control, and modify their remote servers over the internet.

### How Does SSH Work

The SSH command consists of 3 distinct parts:

```json
ssh {user}@{host}
```

The SSH key command instructs your system that you want to open an encrypted Secure Shell Connection.
`{user}`; represents the acount you want to access.
`{host}`: refers to computer you want to access. Can be IP or domain name.

Gaining an in-depth understanding of the underlying how SSH works can help users understand the security aspects of this technology.
